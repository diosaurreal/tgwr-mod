  ww1_liman_affair.1.t: "[TUR.getname] Approaches the General Staff"
  ww1_liman_affair.1.d: "A formal request has arrived from the Sublime Porte. The Ottoman government, still reeling from its disastrous defeats in the Balkan Wars, seeks immediate assistance in reforming its military forces.\n\nSpecifically, Constantinople is asking Berlin to send a team of high-ranking officers to restructure and retrain the Ottoman army. The proposed mission would place a German general at the head of a key command post within the army — possibly even in Constantinople itself.\n\nThis request presents an opportunity to greatly expand our influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, at the gates of the Dardanelles. But it will not go unnoticed. Russia, in particular, regards the Straits as a vital interest and may view our involvement as a provocation.\n\nWe must decide: do we take the lead in Ottoman reform — and risk a diplomatic storm?"
  ww1_liman_affair.1.a: "Naturally, we accept"
  ww1_liman_affair.1.b: "Our generals should be kept at home"
  
  ww1_liman_affair.2.t: "[GER.getname] Decline our Request"
  ww1_liman_affair.2.d: "The response from Berlin has arrived — and it is not what we hoped.\n\nDespite our formal request for assistance in reforming and modernizing our armed forces, the German government has declined to send a military advisory mission to Constantinople. While the note is courteous and diplomatic, the message is clear: Germany is unwilling to risk tension with the Russian Empire over our strategic future.\n\nThis decision leaves the Ottoman military exposed and politically weakened after the disastrous Balkan Wars."
  ww1_liman_affair.2.a: "Damn"
  
  ww1_liman_affair.3.t: "[GER.getname] Accepts our Request"
  ww1_liman_affair.3.d: "A message from Berlin has arrived, bearing excellent news. The German government has accepted our request and will dispatch a military advisory mission to assist in the reform of our armed forces. The mission will be led by General Otto Liman von Sanders, an experienced officer tasked with reorganizing key army units and bringing our training and command structures up to modern European standards. Notably, he will assume direct command over a corps stationed near Constantinople.\n\nThis is a major diplomatic and military victory for the Sublime Porte. However, it will not go unnoticed by our northern neighbor. The Russians consider the Straits vital to their ambitions, and a German officer in our capital may provoke their anger.\n\nWe must proceed carefully — but the Empire may yet find its strength again."
  ww1_liman_affair.3.a: "Great!"

  ww1_liman_affair.4.t: "The Kaiser's men in Turkey"
  ww1_liman_affair.4.d: "Intelligence reports confirm that Berlin has accepted Constantinople's request for military advisors. General Liman von Sanders has been appointed to lead a mission to reform the Ottoman army — and has even been granted command over troops stationed near the Straits.\n\nThis development has alarmed both Paris and Saint Petersburg. A German presence at the gates of the Dardanelles could threaten French influence in the eastern Mediterranean and restrict Russian access to warm waters. Diplomats warn that this is not just military assistance — it is a calculated move to extend Germany's reach into the Near East.\n\nThe government now faces a choice. Should we formally protest and support Russian demands to limit the German mission, or remain quiet to avoid inflaming tensions further?"
  ww1_liman_affair.4.a: "We must object"
  ww1_liman_affair.4.b: "Let's not start a crisis over this"

  ww1_liman_affair.5.t: "The Kaiser's men in Turkey"
  ww1_liman_affair.5.d: "Our military attachés in Constantinople have confirmed a grave development: Berlin has accepted the Ottoman request for military assistance. General Otto Liman von Sanders is to take command of a newly formed German mission — and, more troublingly, has been granted direct control over one of the Ottoman army corps stationed near the Bosphorus.\n\nThis is not a mere training mission. It is a strategic incursion by Germany into our backyard, placing their officers at the very gates of the Straits — our gateway to the Mediterranean.\n\nIf we remain silent, we risk appearing weak, and may lose influence in the Near East entirely. But should we object, we may provoke a diplomatic confrontation with Berlin, and force Paris and London to take a stand.\n\nThe fate of our southern frontier hangs in the balance."
  ww1_liman_affair.5.a: "We must object"

  ww1_liman_affair.6.t: "[FRA.getname] asks for Support"
  ww1_liman_affair.6.d: "The Foreign Office has received an urgent communiqué from Paris: the French government, alarmed by Germany's growing military influence in Constantinople, is requesting our support in a joint protest. The recent appointment of General Liman von Sanders to lead the German advisory mission in the Ottoman Empire — with authority over units stationed near the Dardanelles — has enraged Russia and raised serious concerns across the Quai d'Orsay.\n\nWhile we do not hold direct military interests in the Ottoman army, any shift in the balance of power around the Straits could threaten the Eastern Mediterranean and imperial routes to India.\n\nShould we stand beside our French and Russian partners in pressuring Berlin? Or would a protest endanger our own neutrality in an increasingly fragile European order?"
  ww1_liman_affair.6.a: "We shall support the French"
  ww1_liman_affair.6.b: "I think we should stay out of this"

  ww1_liman_affair.7.t: "[RUS.getname] asks for Support"
  ww1_liman_affair.7.d: "The Russian government has formally reached out to Paris regarding the growing crisis in the Ottoman Empire. With Berlin's military mission now fully established — and General Liman von Sanders in command of troops stationed near the Bosphorus — Saint Petersburg demands a coordinated diplomatic response.\n\nThe Russians consider this German maneuver a direct threat to their influence over the Straits and a breach of the regional balance of power. They now call upon us, as their principal ally, to support their protest and confront Germany diplomatically.\n\nThe Quai d'Orsay must weigh its options. A firm protest will demonstrate solidarity and may help contain German ambitions — but it risks provoking a broader diplomatic crisis at a time when Europe is already dangerously tense."
  ww1_liman_affair.7.a: "Brothers in arms"
  ww1_liman_affair.7.b: "I think we should stay out of this"

  ww1_liman_affair.8.t: "[RUS.getname] asks for Support"
  ww1_liman_affair.8.d: "The Russian Foreign Ministry has formally requested our support in the growing crisis surrounding the German military mission in Constantinople. General Liman von Sanders has assumed a prominent command post near the Bosphorus, and Saint Petersburg views this as a direct threat to its strategic interests in the Straits.\n\nThe Russians urge us to join a coordinated protest against German interference in Ottoman affairs, alongside France. They warn that inaction will embolden Berlin and destabilize the eastern Mediterranean — a region of importance not only to Russia, but to our own imperial communications with India.\n\nHowever, our commitments to Russia remain informal, and any overt action may undermine our diplomatic balancing act. Should we respond to this call — or maintain our distance?"
  ww1_liman_affair.8.a: "We shall support the Russians"

  ww1_liman_affair.9.t: "The Liman von Sanders Affair"
  ww1_liman_affair.9.d: "A diplomatic storm is brewing in the eastern Mediterranean. Following the Ottoman Empire's formal request for foreign military assistance, the German government has dispatched a mission led by General Otto Liman von Sanders to oversee the reform of the Ottoman army.\n\nThough framed as a routine advisory effort, the decision to grant Liman command over a corps stationed in Constantinople has provoked strong reactions. Russia, viewing this as a threat to its access to the Straits, has issued formal protests, urging its French and British partners to join in pressuring Berlin. France already responded with concern and British deliberations are underway."
  ww1_liman_affair.9.a: "God save us, not another crisis..."
  
  ww1_liman_affair.10.t: "Demands from Russia to Stop our Military Mission"
  ww1_liman_affair.10.d: "A sharp diplomatic note has been delivered from Saint Petersburg. The Russian Empire formally objects to our military mission in the Ottoman Empire, and in particular, to General Liman von Sanders' appointment to a key command post near the Bosphorus.\n\nRussia asserts that our presence at the Straits threatens its maritime access to the Mediterranean and violates the delicate balance of influence in the Near East. The note urges Berlin to revise the structure of the mission and limit our officers' authority to advisory functions only.\n\nWithin the Foreign Office and General Staff, opinions are divided. Some argue that yielding to Russian demands would undermine our credibility and squander a rare opportunity to expand our influence. Others caution that insisting on full control may trigger an international crisis with unpredictable consequences.\n\nThe decision now lies with the Reich."

  ww1_liman_affair.11.t: "Demands from France to Stop our Military Mission"
  ww1_liman_affair.11.d: "A diplomatic communiqué has arrived from Paris. In full support of Russian concerns, the French government has joined the protest against our military mission in the Ottoman Empire. The French demand that General Liman von Sanders be reassigned to a strictly advisory role, and that Germany refrain from assuming any direct command over Ottoman forces stationed in or near the Straits. Paris warns that ignoring these calls risks destabilizing the region and heightening European tensions.\n\nThe timing of this note is no coincidence. It confirms a coordinated Franco-Russian front, determined to contain our influence in Constantinople and beyond. The Reich must now decide: assert our rights, or offer a diplomatic gesture to preserve peace."

In response to growing diplomatic pressure — particularly from Russia — Berlin has agreed to limit the authority of General Liman von Sanders.\n\nWhile Liman will remain at the head of the advisory mission to the Ottoman army, he will no longer hold operational command over troops stationed near Constantinople and the Straits. The Russian government, which had voiced concerns alongside France, is treating this as a clear diplomatic success.\n\nThough the immediate crisis has been averted, the broader implications remain. Germany retains a strong advisory role in the Ottoman military, and its influence in the eastern Mediterranean is still expanding.

France, echoing Russian concerns, had called on Berlin to revise the mission and prevent Liman from holding direct authority over Ottoman forces stationed near the Straits.\n\nBerlin has now formally declined to alter the structure of the mission. The German Foreign Office defends the decision as a matter of sovereign cooperation between allies, but critics argue it represents a provocative assertion of influence in a region already rife with instability.\n\nObservers warn that the situation may escalate further if other powers choose to respond. The Eastern Question — long dormant — has returned to the forefront of European diplomacy."

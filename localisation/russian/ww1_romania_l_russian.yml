ROM_deal_with_the_liberal_king_desc: "The last man that can threaten our power is the king himself. Aligned with the liberals, King Ferdinand clearly cannot be trusted! He would take any opportunity he could get to depose us for his prefered party, the PNL - or whats left of it. With parliament disbanded, Carp himself will assume responsibility for writing a new constitution, one which will protect Romanian democracy from the king by removing his ability to dismiss governments."

ROM_new_constitution_desc: "With the advent of universal male suffrage, the question begs to be asked: why not go all the way? Stere is drafting a new constitution with the assistance of the others in coalition with the PNL. Once that is completed it will be brought before parliament, voted on, and most likely put into place. We hold the support of most of the population in this endeavor. Change is coming, and we shall greet it with open arms."
ROM_cooperative_agriculture: "Сельские Кооперативы"
ROM_cooperative_agriculture_desc: "To achieve maximum efficiency in our farms the idea of cooperative agriculture has floated around. During wartime it would secure our food situation more than allowing the current profit-driven practices to continue. We are certain to face blowback from the peasantry, but in time they will realize that this was the best course all along when their bellies are fuller due to it."
ROM_nationalize_steel_industry: "Национализация Метталургии"
ROM_nationalize_steel_industry_desc: "Many different goods and materials are essential to our economy, but none quite as essential as our steel industry. Guns, planes, machines: all require this commodity. A radical idea has been proposed by the more left-leaning members of our coalition, the idea being nationalization. If we did this we would strengthen the integrity of our econonmy greatly, although the disturbance to the otherwise free market may cause a stir."
ROM_poporanist: "Попоранизм"
ROM_poporanist_desc: "Poporanism is the Romanian ideal of nationalism and populism. It was created by Constantin Stere and is centered around increasing the political power of the peasants, which in turn support the state, leading to a government with the power to do what it wants.

ROM_expansion_of_the_middle_class_desc: "The middle class is the foundation of our economy and society. The working class and the peasantry do their jobs, sure, but it is the managers, the shopowners, and the farmers that create most of the wealth through their efforts. If we bolster their ranks, we bolster our economy and reap all the benefits that come from it. It doesn't hurt that they also vote the most..."
ROM_lessons_from_denmark: "Датский Опыт"
ROM_lessons_from_denmark_desc: "The small Scandinavian country of Denmark has practiced cooperative farming for centuries, starting from the black death in the 1300s. While the effects of the policy has already made its positive mark on the agricultural sector, the anger felt in the protests against this new direction hit just as hard. Adopting some of the refined practices from Denmark may prove to bring these protests to a close, as the Danes have perfected this economic model to an artform, bringing prosperity not just to the government but to the farmers as well."
ROM_peasants_democracy: "Крестьянская Демократия"
ROM_peasants_democracy_desc: "The march towards absolute land reform continues under Stere's loving hand. The new constitution has allowed more effective measures to be put into practice. More and more land is being redistributed in the people's favor, and Stere certaintly reaps the benefit. His government's popularity is now through the roof.

ROM_de_polarization_desc: "Why must everyone be an ultra-nationalist or a Marxist? Why can't we all get along, hold hands, and sing together in a poppy field? There must be something we can do to make everyone nice to each other! Well, for a start, we can politically disenfranchise polarizing individuals and promote interparty cooperation. Everyone will be happy, or else!"
ROM_transition_towards_a_socialist_economy: "Переход к Социалистической Экономике"
ROM_transition_towards_a_socialist_economy_desc: "Upon nationalizing the steel industry the free market has been thrown into disaray. It's now or nothing. Laws are being drafted to strangle the free market in order to usher in a new normal: state socialism. These laws simultaneously pave the route to nationalizing more essential industries, though not all at once. It will be a gradual process, but eventually Stere's vision will be realized."
ROM_alliance_with_the_pdsr: "Альянс с PDSR"
ROM_alliance_with_the_pdsr_desc: "The Marxists of the PDSR currently run opposed to us as we do to them. This could change. We are more alike than we think, and in our transition into a socialist form of economy we may invite their help in this regard. This transition is sure to ripple across the Romanian worker's world and to have friends with roots in the Romanian labor movement would prove beneficial to our cause."
ROM_invite_french_socialists: "Пригласить Французских Социалистов"
ROM_invite_french_socialists_desc: "Our cooperation with the PDSR has done us great good. It would serve us well to broaden our support among the workers of the world by advertising ourselves as pro-labor in addition to our already pro-peasantry ideals. What better to recieve such acclaim and assistance from then if not the most successful socialists of all: the French! "
ROM_restructure_our_logistics: "Улучшить Логистику"
ROM_restructure_our_logistics_desc: "With the needs of the armed forces expanding, it has become evident that our current logistics network is insufficient.

ROM_slow_and_steady_wins_the_race_desc: "The laws have passed. The process of nationalizing our most important industries has begun. Despite all the excitement around the event, we must excerise caution. Too much or to little could have catastrophic effects on our economy. We cannot afford to do anything that may bring it all to a dissapointing and dangerous halt. It is key that we take this slow."

ROM_the_lame_duck: "Хромая Утка"

ROM_reunify_the_conservatives_desc: "Egads! The socialists are definitely threatening our government! This is no manufactured situation, we would never do such a thing. This is real and this is dangerous! We must join arm in arm with our fellow conservatives against this threat, consequently giving us a majority in parliament... But who cares about that!"

ROM_preventing_a_brain_drain_desc: "Our socialist policies have frightened off some of our most innovative minds. The gunsmiths, the scientists, the plane designers, all seek to flee the country after percieving the effect of our agenda as one of silencing and oppression. They must be reassured that this is not the case, and that innovation is valued. The only thing that has changed is it is all under the kind eye of the government now instead of being left to market fluctuations."

ROM_investigate_bureaucratic_corruption_desc: "While the rotation of parties had its benefits, it cannot be ignored how it enabled corruption.

ROM_reduce_trade_barriers_with_germany_desc: "The previous civilian government was hesitant to engage in broader trade with Germany. This was a mistake and it has cost us great growth. Now though, now we can make amends for this and lower tariffs to incentivize German investment. Our populace may disagree, but this is the best course for Romania."
ROM_de_politicize_key_cabinet_positions: "Деполитизация Кабинета Министров"
ROM_de_politicize_key_cabinet_positions_desc: "Partisan politics often dictate who the government must select as candidates for the cabinet. It shouldn't be decided by clout, but rather by ability. Making these positions strictly meritocratic will give the country more assurance that their government isn't simply twiddling their thumbs, but actually doing their best to improve the lives of the commonfolk."

ROM_end_antisemitism_desc: "Unfortunately antisemitism is common in Romania. While Jews were given citizenship in the 1860s, they are still the target of discrimination, with the PNL and Poporanists blaming them for all of society's problems. This blight on our country shall be removed."
ROM_grand_coalition: "Великая Коалиция"
ROM_grand_coalition_desc: "The time has come to put aside ideology in favor of complete and absolute loyalty to king and nation. The parties already proclaim themselves as such, however they certaintly don't show it. To address this lack of motivation to make the lives of their constituents better, the King has proclaimed the need to form a Grand Coalition headed by the PCD. Parliament is almost certain to accept, increasing the people's confidence in their governance."

ROM_support_romanian_literature_desc: "Romanian writing is an untapped goldmine. The novelists and poets that sit impoverished in Bucharest apartments need a helping hand, as their writings are worth more than any money we could provide them. The time for a cultural revival is nigh, and the artists of our nation will light the way."
ROM_fight_illiteracy: "Борьба с Безграмотностью"
ROM_fight_illiteracy_desc: "Books are lovely things. Those who have the luxury of reading them in our country are lucky indeed. What is more important, though, is the ability to read signs, proclamations, newspapers; things that are needed to remain informed and safe. The problem is that our populace is not fully literate, meaning during wartime they won't be able to do much with the information we provide them on the war effort. This must be changed, and it can be changed."
ROM_secure_the_countryside: "Заручиться Поддержкой на Селе"
ROM_secure_the_countryside_desc: "The country side is still full of rioting and anarchy from the recent peasant revolt. While some of their frustrations were indeed valid, we need to restore law and order. We should authorize the army to march north and put down protesters."
ROM_prussian_values: "Прусские Ценности"

ROM_expanding_our_majority_in_parliament_desc: "The success of the party in charge of government has made ripples in Romanian society.

ROM_enforce_fiscal_sustainability_desc: "During wartime our budget goes through the roof. Loans must be taken out and our economy overall suffers. This cannot be easily remedied, as war is demanding. What can be done though is making sure we can function without loans during peacetime. The path towards fiscal austerity is the path we need to go venture down. Once we achieve that we can begin talking about reducing the effect of war, which is surely on the horizon."

Perhaps those legends held no concrete value then, but nowadays they provide a strong lesson: electricity changes the world. It isn't so hard to see that it already is doing so in various states across Europe. It's about time that we harness lightning to its absolute potential too, and give some meaning back to those legends along the way."
ROM_import_foreign_tools: "Импорт Иностранной Техники"
ROM_import_foreign_tools_desc: "With industrial progress comes the eventual need for greater and greater measures. Eventually nations arrive at a hurdle they cannot leap, and are forced to resort to outside help, weakening them. We need to preempt this eventuality by seeking help now while our progress is still increasing exponentially. If this challenge is dealt with, we can then turn our attention to further industrial investements."

ROM_concessions_to_the_upper_class_desc: "Progress is a wonderous thing to behold, but sometimes it's scary. Not to the average citizen, but to the entrenched nobility, worried that with progress comes change, change that can uproot them from their positions of power. While it would be wonderful to simply ignore this, there lies the problem of their positions of power and the influence they hold over our economy. To assuage their fears we must assure them that waves of progress will not wash up on their shores. "
ROM_support_industrialists: "Поддержать Промышленников"
ROM_support_industrialists_desc: "The driving force behind most of this investment has been the groups of wealthy industrialists that lobby our government to expand operations. They have been and will be crucial to any further effort. We must court them with agreements and promises that would allow them to pursue their business as they please in exchange for continued support."
ROM_agricultural_knowledge: "Новые Методы Земледелия"
ROM_agricultural_knowledge_desc: "The drive towards industrialization continues. However, the drive towards agricultural progress has stagnated. If we were to neglect the backbone of our economy industrialization would be out of the question. The only answer lies in prioritizing our farms over our factories for the time being. Slow and steady wins the race, and we cannot afford to be anything other than steady."

ROM_government_aid_to_industries_desc: "Direct subsidies have proved effective during this process of industrialization. Now the industrialists are providing the government with opportunities for expansion of the construction industry in Bucharest. We can and will pay for this. Slowly but surely we are initiating a snowball effect buoyed by loans and government money, this is but one step in sustaining that."
ROM_move_away_from_an_export_based_economy: "Отход от Экспортной Экономики"
ROM_move_away_from_an_export_based_economy_desc: "We cannot rely on the stability of the nations around us. Eventually the precarious house of cards will come crashing down all around us, and we can't be reliant on those that crash the hardest if we wish to prosper. Yes, this may increase prices and sour diplomatic relations, but that is a cost we can pay. It is a cost we need to pay."
ROM_doubuja_steel_industry: "Металлургия Мутении"
ROM_doubuja_steel_industry_desc: "In Muntenia, there are a few steel mills but they are relatively small. As our industry expands, so does the need for more steel. We must expand the steel industry in this region, and the jobs that would be created from such industries would be helpful aswell."
ROM_expand_doubruja_dockyards: "Расширение Дунайских Портов"
ROM_expand_doubruja_dockyards_desc: "We have one connection to the sea; one piece of land seperating us from total reliance on our neighbors. We need to make sure that this saving grace does not go unused. Strong investments in our ports would allow for greater capacity for trade, both exporting and importing, as well as expanded shipbuilding, if we were ever to aspire towards a strong Black Sea navy."
ROM_increase_cereal_exports: "Увеличить Экспорт Злаков"
ROM_increase_cereal_exports_desc: "While we are attempting to shift from an agricultural society to a modern one, it would be foolish not to reap the benefits of our current harvest. With the population of the world ever increasing, so does the amount of mouths to feed. We can leverage our lucrative cereal exports to ensure that it is Romanian harvests reach those mouths and Romanian pockets that are being filled."

ROM_ramp_up_exports_of_fruit_grains_and_seeds_desc: "Our country produces a lot of agricultural products such as grains and fruits. Some of these are in high demand in foreign countries as they cannot grow them as well, so we should ramp up exports of these products as it would help our economy a lot."
ROM_increase_gold_and_silver_exports: "Экспорт Золота и Серебра"
ROM_increase_gold_and_silver_exports_desc: "Regular gold has always been a strong export of ours, but the reason that we must emphasise that it's regular is because a rip-off gold is getting big, somehow. Some business owners in Bucharest are going crazy over Fool's Gold, calling it the next big thing and saying that it'll soon replace real gold. People didn't pay them any mind, but somehow Fool's Gold shot up in value. It then plummeted again, but that still hasn't dissuaded a lot of people for some reason."

ROM_expansion_of_the_lumber_industry_desc: "The lands near the mountains are filled with endless seas of strong lumber, painting a green canopy alongside the Carpathians.

ROM_trade_deals_with_germany_and_austria_desc: "Our friends across the Carpathians are more than eager to engage with our trade opportunites. Their friends, the Germans, meet that same level of eagerness. Whether out of interest in economic dominance, fear of failed harvests, or stocking up for impending war, we simply cannot say no to their offers. It's not like we have more options, after all."
ROM_close_the_trade_defict: "Сокращение Торгового Дефицита"
ROM_close_the_trade_defict_desc: "With our exports through the roof and domestic production ramping up we have nearly eliminated our trade deficit. Nothing more can be done other than negotiate and politic our way into better deals in order to reach that goal. Chief among these opportunites lies with the Austrians. They grow ever more desperate, especially considering the fragility of their empire is being tested constantly. It would be foolish of us not to exploit these conditions.  "

ROM_spike_interest_rates_desc: "Inflation is a problem that damages the foundations of any state: the commonfolk. A good measure to take in order to secure the foundations of our new state of Greater Romania is to ease these economic hardships by raising interest rates. It is an imperfect solution, but it works and that's the best we can hope for."

ROM_brutal_economic_realism: "Brutal Economic Realism"

ww1_romania.173.d: "Delavrancea's rebranding of the PC back to a elitist, urban party has proved itself immensely unpoular amongst the rural part of the PC, which had been growing in influence for the last few years. With Delavrancea removing agrarianists from government positions, many agrarianists have begun to flee the PC all together. They see the PCD as more and more appealing, and have decided their best bets are with them. While this will reduce factionalism, it will also hurt the overall size of our party."

ww1_romania.78.t: "The 'Swamp' Demand Protection"
ww1_romania.78.d: "The so-called swamp of Romanian politics, consisting of unelected appointed government positions, often in which jobs are given to friends and family, are opposing our governments campaign to help reduce corruption in government. Those in the PNL in particular are demanding protection from these efforts, and are threatening to oppose our government if we don't"
ww1_romania.78.a: "We can make some exceptions"
ww1_romania.78.b: "Who do they think they are?"
ww1_romania.18.d: "With the king losing faith in the current government, the current Prime Minister has been forced to resign. With the Prime Minister spot vacant, the king will now have to form a new government. The king has several different options available, and must pick the best one. Who shall be appointed to form the next government?"
ww1_romania.18.a: "The PCD will lead a stable government!"

ww1_romania.18.c: "Lets appoint someone from the PC"
ww1_romania.20.t: "The Left Boycotts Election for Bucharest Council"
ww1_romania.20.d: "As a way to protest the new conservative government, the PNL and some in the PCD have decided they will be boycotting the elections for Bucharest Council. By showing low turnout will end up being, they hope to prove that the people do not actually support the conservatives. They're free to do this, as it will just ensure we win the election. The conservatives are divided however, in many different factions. While the king appointed Carp's faction of the conservatives in power as Prime Minister, the people will have to pick which conservative faction wins this one.\n\nOne of the canidates aligns with Carp's more elitist, authoritarian group of conservatives. They believe vast reforms arn't needed for Romania, and that parliament has been given much more power then it really should have. The other canidate comes from the anti Carp faction of the conservatives. Generally younger, and more centrist, they believe Carp holds a threat to Romanian democracy and want greater reforms to Romania's economy."
ww1_romania.20.a: "The pro Carp faction wins!"
ww1_romania.20.b: "The 'Romanian Young-Turks' win!"
ww1_romania.18.t: "King Appoints New Government"
ww1_romania.17.d: "The recently announced Romanian elections have came to an end. With the votes being counted up, the PC has been announced the winner of the elections, securing a quite large electoral landslide. With this, we will finally have the mandate to pass out agenda. The Romanian people still expect reforms to continue, so we must be careful in our leadership. Failing to govern properly could lead to King Carol outright dismissing us!"
ww1_romania.77.t: "Which PC Faction Should We Appoint?"
ww1_romania.77.d: ""
ww1_romania.17.a: "Finally! Let's get to governing"
ww1_romania.16.t: "PC Accuses us of Corruption!"
ww1_romania.16.d: "Members of the PC have been intensifying their attacks on us as of lately, this time accusing us of favortism in the cabinet. They claim the PNL government has been giving unqualified members cabinet positions just for their loyalty, instead of their merit. These are mostly baseless, but they're hurting our support amongst the population. King Carol has also expressed his concern about the issue privately with Bratianu, stating their may be some truth in it and that the PNL needs to reform itself. "
ww1_romania.16.a: "It's lies and propaganda!"
ww1_romania.15.t: "Alliance with the PND?"
ww1_romania.15.d: "With the PCD-PNL alliance announced, we have a chance to form our own electoral alliance. While the PND isn't nearly as popular as the PCD, it does have its own small, yet loyal base of support. Additionally, alligning ourselves with the PND will further symbolizes the PCD's shift towards the left economically. This could allow us to out-flank the PNL's economically left base, which would help us significantly.\n\nThe problem is, however, that the PND could have its own baggade. The PND is seen as very extreme by most of the country, and for good reason. The PND has had its own history of using violence to gain political support, and some PND members have... questionable takes on the Jewish community, to say the least. It would also anger King Carol, who already believes Carp may be too arogant and extreme to win an election."
ww1_romania.15.a: "We'll fight fire with fire!"
ww1_romania.15.b: "What do we have to gain from these fools?"
ww1_romania.14.t: "PNL Announces Alliance with the PCD"
ww1_romania.14.d: "With Carp rejecting the kings requests to reconcile the PCD, the PNL and PCD have announced an electoral coalition to oppose the PC. With this alliance, the tides have shifted against the PC and towards the PNL-PCD alliance. Although not ideal, we must remain confident about our chances next election. "
ww1_romania.14.a: "They're desperate, clearly!"
ww1_romania.13.t: "The Consensus of the Centre"
ww1_romania.13.d: "The recent formation of the PC-PCD alliance has given the coalition a significant boost in the polls. While at first many predicted the race as a complete-tossup, and some experts even seeing the election as leaning towards the PNL, the PC-PCD alliance has been gaining significant ground across the country. With the shift of the right towards the centre, peasants who were originally concerned the Conservatives would oppose new land reform have been softened, while many see the issues with the PNL and its corruption scandals."
ww1_romania.13.a: "Its time to turn a new leaf!"
ww1_romania.12.t: "Alexandru Marghiloman Proposes... Securing 'Election Security'"
ww1_romania.12.d: "While the conservatives are the incumbents, theres still a reformist mood across much of country. Many political experts are calling the race a complete tossup, with some even saying the election leans towards the PNL. Another PNL government would be unacceptable, to say the least. Seeing the situation, Minister of the Interior Alexandru Marghiloman has proposed to Carp a way to secure our victory: tampering with the election. While of course not... morally great, it would indeed secure a win."
ww1_romania.12.a: "What? Uh yeah, yeah that sounds great"
ww1_romania.12.b: "Have some confidence in us, Marghiloman!"
ww1_romania.11.t: "King Carol Requests We Mantain Previous PNL Land Reform"
ww1_romania.11.d: "While the most recent PNL land reform bill failed, the PNL has indeed passed many significant reforms since the 1907 revolt. With conservatives in power, some in the party, including Carp, believe repealing some of these reforms should be considered. King Carol obviously disagrees, being the one who appointed the liberals in the first place. Now that conservatives have came into power, Carol has quested Carp take the position many in the conservatives have taken as of late: fully endorse previous land reform, and promise not to overturn it. This, Carol claims, is needed to mantain stability and avoid another 1907. While Carp may disagree, its clear Carol feels strongly on this issue. Opposing him here may lead him to be significantly less confident in our government."
ww1_romania.11.a: "Letting the king dictate party policy would be a bad precedent"
ww1_romania.11.b: "Don't worry, we agree these measures are reasonable"
ww1_romania.10.t: "King Carol Requests Carp Reconcile the PCD"
ww1_romania.10.d: "The PCD - formally known as the Partidul Conservator-Democrat, and its rivarly with the PC is widely known. Originating as a splinter from the PC, the PCD claims to be the most moderate of the main 3 Romanian parties. Generally being economically moderate while socially conservative, the PCD rose to popularity after it splintered from the PC, having ran multiple governments themselves. Now, with the first conservative government in years, King Carol is urgent to ensure it remains stable. With the PCD and the PC agreeing on many things, as well as most of the PCD party leaders having history in the PC, Carol sees an opprotunity for the 2 parties to form a centre right government. While Carp himself is personally opposed to the idea, its welcomed by many moderates in the party. Ensuring Carol supports the government will also be crucial to its survival. Is angering Carol really worth it here?"
ww1_romania.10.a: "Respectfully your majesty, we'd be better without them"
ww1_romania.10.b: "Alright, lets form a coalition government"
ww1_romania.9.t: "Forming a New Government"
ww1_romania.17.t: "PC Majority Elected!"
ww1_romania.9.a: "Lets see how they do!"
ww1_romania.9.d: "With the failure to pass land reform, Prime Minister Brătianu has decided to resign in protest. With the king being tasked to form a new government, its been decided to give the conservative PC party a chance to govern. While being out of power for the last few years, the PC has gone through a dramatic shift. Going from a outright elitist party, the PC has seen the need to change and thus the party has rebranded itself, shifting to the left on a variety of issues including labor rights and the economy. While Carol has appointed the PC to rule, Carol is no tyrant. Thus, elections set to take place in 1911 have been announced."
ww1_romania.8.t: "The Carol Mosque"
ww1_romania.8.d: "While the Muslim population in Romania is small, they do have prominence. As a sign of respect and solidarity with Romanian Muslims, as well as an act of good will to the Ottoman Empire, King Carol today ordered construction to begin on a grand mosque in Constanta, one of our largest cities. While construction will be slow, the ambitious project will certainly increase tourism to our country once completed."
ww1_romania.8.a: "We're an inclusive country!"
ww1_romania.1.t: "The Puppet Master"
ww1_romania.28.t: "The Outbreak of the Great War"
ww1_romania.28.d: "The Central Powers vs the Entente, it's the biggest war in human history. With our key position in Europe, there's lots of focus towards us, and what we will do. While a lot of our population is either pro Entente or pro neutrality, we currently have a defensive pact with the Central Powers. While we aren't legally under any obligation to join the war, German and Austrian diplomats have been heavily pressuring our country to join their side as of late, promising vast Russian territories.\n\nIt's unknown if our army is truely ready for a war yet, but joining Germany now could be our best chance to quickly secure our desired territory in Russia while Russia finds itself unprepared. On the otherhand, it may be safer and more practical to simply wait it out, and see how the war progresses. What's the plan?"
ww1_romania.28.a: "We're not ready to take any drastic options here, let's stay neutral for now"
ww1_romania.28.b: "The liberation of Moldova awaits!"
ww1_romania.79.t: "National Opposition Organizes"
ww1_romania.79.d: "Opposition in the Romanian political parties have formed to counteract on Carp's policies for Romania."
ww1_romania.79.a: "We need to put out this fire."
ROM_national_opposition_organizes: "Add §YNational Opposition'§! which grants:\nPolitical Power gain: §R-50%§!\nStability: §R-40.00%§!"
ww1_romania.80.t: "The Carp Constitution"
ww1_romania.80.d: "With parliament fully behind Carp, Carp and his allies have began to draft a new constitution. This new constitution greatly expands the powers of the Prime Minister, strips the king of all executive powers, and removes most current checks and balances that exist in Romania. The vote has passed with zero dissenter, showing a clear mandate for Carp. With this new constitution, all obsticles of Carp have been effectively neutralized. Thus, the Carp era can begin."
ww1_romania.80.a: "Glory!"
ww1_romania.1.d: "The Romanian constitution of 1866 has often been praised as one of the most modern constitutions in the world at the time, with separation of powers, an abolished death penalty, guaranteed private property, freedom of speech, and total freedom of the press. However, the Romanian constitution has changed very little since then, and thus Romania has fallen from one of the most democratic countries at its time, to the flawed constitutional monarchy it is now.\n\nWhether this is a positive or negative development for Romania is debatable, but one thing can be agreed upon by everyone: King Carol's influence on the Romanian political system is immense, and has grown in recent times. King Carol has often simply rotated between forming a government with the liberal PNL, and the conservative PC, as well as the recently formed moderate PCD. This has lead to little actual reform in Romania, as opposing political parties overturn much of the reforms the last government passed. This culminated in a revolt by angry peasants in 1907, angered by the little reform passed by any government. Thus, King Carol has taken a new course, appointing a liberal government that has governed the country for the last 3 years straight, passing a suprisingly large amount of reforms as of recent, which has kept the peasants in line for now.\n\nWith the 1911 elections approaching, King Carols confidence in the liberals and their ability to govern has declined. Seeing it as time for a new party to get a chance to rule Romania, King Carol has been flirting with the idea of appoiting a conservative government, or at least supporting the conservatives in the elections."

ww1_romania.88.t: "Petre Carp Forms Government in Romania"
ww1_romania.88.d: "With the results of Romania's recent elections in, Petre Carp's conservative party has captured a majority in parliament. Thus, King Carol has given them the task of forming a government. Notably, Petre Carp has long been a Germophile and has written several works calling for the 'liberation' of Moldova from the Russian Empire. With this, many are expecting Romania to draw closer to Germany. Even more concerningly for the entente, Carp has shown authoritarian tendencies in the past and in his current rhetoric, and thus it's unknown if Carp would be willing to give up power."

ww1_romania.89.d: "Today the King tasked the liberal PNL party of Romania to form a new government. Notably, many in the PNL are outspoken Francophiles, and thus many expect this new government may draw closer to the Entente. This would prove a big blow to the Central Powers, which has heavily influenced Romania in the past. Already, the new government has began outreach to France, and suprisingly, Russia, to strengthen ties. Although nothing is guaranteed, this seems to be a big blow to Germany."

Conservatives of course oppose the bill, but moderates, and the king are also wary. Most likely being out of touch, they see previous measures of the government as able enough, and see this bill as risking a Romanian brain drain. Passing this bill won't be easy, and we will need careful maneuvering to get a majority of the votes."

ww1_romania.4.t: ""The Brătianu Land Reform Bill - Convincing the PCD"
ww1_romania.4.d: "The current make up of Romania's parliament means that convincing moderates to support the land reform bill will be required to pass it. Several members from the PCD, a splinter from the more conservative PC, seems somewhat open to the land reform bill we've proposed. Some do fear its a bit too extreme, but changing the bill at all may risk angering the more liberal members of our party, who may protest vote against the bill. What will our next course be?"
ww1_romania.3.t: ""The Brătianu Land Reform Bill - Landlords Petition the Government"
ww1_romania.3.d: "The all powerful landlords in Romania have protested our recent land reform bill currently being debated in parliament. Providing a variety of reasons why the bill would hurt Romania's society and economy, they've heavily encouraged us to abandon the bill altogether. While they don't hold votes in parliament, their opposition to our government would hurt our position a lot, considerng their vast influence in the country"

ww1_romania.5.d: "Bad news for the PNL: the major land reform bill proposed in recent has died in parliament. With the past land reform bills passing overwhelmingly, in part due to fear from the 1907 peasant revolution, many are suprised and worried to see the failure of this bill. While progress has been made, many feel its not enough, and the failure of the bill has lead to many peasants fearing that no more progress on the issue will be made. Either way, this news definitely won't help the popularity of the liberal governmen, even if the bill failing wasn't exactly their fault."
ww1_romania.6.t: "The Brătianu Land Reform Bill - King Carol Expresses Concern"
ww1_romania.6.d: "While King Carol explicitly supported the liberals in the aftermath of the 1907 peasant revolt, as well as the liberals land reform bills previously, King Carol has had his scepticism about the land reform bill currently being debated in the Romanian parliament. Seeing this bill as going too far, he's suggested to PNL leaders that they should scale back the bill for the sake of political stability. With the changes Carol is suggesting, the bill would mostly be lip service and thus his changes are unacceptable. King Carol coming out publicly against the bill would, however, be a disaster. While its very doubtful he would take drastic measures like disolving parliament over it, just him opposing the bill would surely lead to many in the PCD abandoning the bill, and thus leading to its death."

King Carol as well as the general Romania populace have been worried as of late about the liberals competency in governance, and with this major bill, their fears should be soothed.

Agreeing the Carp is a threat to democracy, they've called for Carp to resign immediately. With the streets full of protesters, it seems our government may be coming to an end. Unless we are able to ride this storm, the king will certainly dismiss our government."

ww1_romania.23.d: "With our refusal to resign, the PNL has organized mass protests against our government. Rioting has broken out in Bucharest with tens of thousands demanding the PC step down from power. With this, the King has increasingly began weighing his options. Its clear the king is increasingly seeing us as unable to govern, and if we don't fix this issue soon we see our government collapse!"

ww1_romania.36.d: "In France, Russia, Austria, Germany, America, and the vast majority of countries, the political divide is best seen as a rural vs urban issues. Those in the urban areas are generally more liberal while those in rural areas are more conservative. In Romania, however, this is not the case. The rural areas have generally supported the liberal PNL, who has promised them much in the form of land reform, while those in the urban areas generally benefit from the PC's focus on education. With the appointment of Titu Maiorescu, coalitions are shifting once again.\nWith Maiorescu's focus on rural issues, those who have often felt ignored by the elitist conservative PC have began to rethink their future votes. Although not a liberal, Maiorescu has unorthodox views on land reform for a conservative, which has helped shift the rural areas towards the PC. If Maiorescu can sucessfully sway rural Romania to the PC while mantaining strong support in urban areas, it's possible he could secure an electoral mandate for the next 100 years."

As we demobilize and disarm completely, as we sign away the rights to our industry, as we bring ourselves into subservience we have but one reprieve. The farmers won't have to water their fields this harvest, for the blood of their sons soaking the soil does a good enough job."

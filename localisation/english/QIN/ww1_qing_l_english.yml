 QIN_beiyang_army_name_desc:0 "Represents §YMilitarist§! and §YArmed Forces§! in general that remained loyal to §YYuan Shikai§!.\n\n§L§YThe Beiyang Army§! had its origins in the Newly Created Army established in late 1895 under §YYuan Shikai's§! command. Unlike its predecessors, it had a formal structure with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and logistical branches, and maintained strict training and discipline. The brigade-sized force was expanded over the years with new recruits and by incorporating other units, before serving as the core of a larger army after Yuan was appointed the §YViceroy of Zhili§! and Northern Ocean Minister in 1901.\n\nThe tensions between £ww1_game_rule_flag_RUS §YRussia§! and £ww1_game_rule_flag_JAP §YJapan§! in §OManchuria§! in early 1904 caused §YEmpress Dowager Cixi§! to agree to Yuan's request to raise more divisions, and he also used his senior position in the Army Reorganization Bureau to prioritize its funding. \n\nFollowing Yuan Shikai's organization of the §YBeiyang Army§!, the army has become China's first professional armed forces. §YYuan Shikai§! had imposed strict discipline and meritocracy within the military to match with the armies of the western foreign powers. However at the same time, some would view Yuan Shikai's organization as a way of making his own personal army against the interest of the §YQing Dynasty§! by Yuan's political rivals during the Dingwei Struggle. Therefore since Yuan's exile by §YPrince Zaifeng§!, the §YManchu Court§! has attempted to take control of the §YBeiyang Army§! and their loyalties.§!"

 QIN_reformists_name_desc:0 "Represents §YReformers§!, §YConstitutionalist§!, §YDemocrats§!, §YLiberals§!, §YSelf Strengtheners§! and §YModerates§! within the §YChinese Bureaucracy§!\n\n§YThe Reformist Faction§! §Lare composed of a collection of bureaucrats, constitutionalist and self-strengtheners who seek to modernize the management of the country through a series of reforms to shift the autocratic §YQing monarchy§L towards a §YConstitiutional Monarchy§L. \nChinese constitutionalism was a movement that originated after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). A young group of intellectuals in China led by Kang Youwei argued that China's defeat was due to its lack of modern institutions and legal framework which the Self-Strengthening Movement had failed to deliver. They saw the recent rise of new powers such as Germany, Italy, and Japan coincide with their adoption of constitutions. By having a constitution as the basis for social and political organization, they surmise that all of China's ills could be repaired. \nTheir primary concern is to preserve the sovereignty of §YChina§! while reforming the state to one day overcome the struggles of the Era of Humiliation."

Their support is vital to the governance of the Qing Dynasty, as without it, the §YImperial Court§! would not be able to enforce its rule beyond the confines of Beijing and to a extent Zhili Province. \n\nWithout their support, adminstration would be near impossible to enforce and angering them could lead to severe consequences. A common goal of the §YChinese Elites§! is to preserve the perceived autonomy and their local political power."

Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War led to loss of suzerainty over Korea and cession of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan. The ambitious Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 proposed fundamental change, but was poorly executed and terminated by the Empress Dowager Cixi in the Wuxu Coup. In 1900, anti-foreign Boxers killed many Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries; in retaliation, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China and imposed a punitive indemnity.\n\nSince then, the central authority has never been so low, and each constituent of the Empire is slowy dissolving into personal agendas.§!"

With growing calls for constitutionalism across the empire, the Prince-Regent Zaifeng has finally approved for limited provincial elections across the country as a part of the ongoing reforms. For the first time in the Empire's history, members of the Advisory Council would be decided through a nationwide electoral voting. Although only half of the members of the council would be elected as a part of this election with the other half still being directly appointed by the regent this will hopefully appease the constitutionalists enough as to stabilise our increasingly fragile political situation.

QIN_phasing_out_banners_decision_desc:0 "The Qing court tried to reform the Eight Banners to adapt to the current situation and establish a new army. Some of the Beijing Banner troops were organized into the first army. However the results were minimal and could not prevent the decline of the Qing Dynasty and the Eight Banners. We can do nothing other than phasing out the Eight Banners while paying for their pensions."

It was later burned down during the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. It was not until Yuan Shikai succeeded as the Governor-General of Zhili that he chose a place outside the city of Dezhou, Shandong, to build a new factory. In 1904, the new factory began production, marking the rebirth of the Tianjin Bureau. We will further these efforts to restore military production by expanding and rebuilding the former industrial capabilities of the Tianjin Arsenal."

QIN_shanghai_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Jiangnan Machinery Manufacturing Bureau was established in Shanghai in 1865. It was a military production organization established during the Westernization Movement of the Qing Dynasty. It was the most important military factory in late Qing China and one of the earliest modern factories. In May 1867, all the equipment originally in Hongkou was moved in. After that, Jiangnan Factory began to manufacture modern internal combustion ships in addition to manufacturing weapons."

QIN_nanjing_arsenal_decision:0 "Revitalize the Jinling Machinery Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_nanjing_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "Jinling Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, was built as a modern industrial building complex in Qinhuai District, Nanjing.

QIN_lanzhou_arsenal_decision:0 "Expand in the Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_lanzhou_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau was one the earliest modern industrial enterprise in Northwest China. Planned and established by Zuo Zongtang, the Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau, after several trials, finally successfully imitated guns and cannons with relatively strong lethality under the backward historical conditions at that time. Zuo Zongtang's Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau successfully imitated the German-made breech-loading screw cannon, which is the world-famous Krupp cannon, and also successfully imitated the Italian heavy artillery and the German breech-loading seven-shot gun."

QIN_hanyang_arsenal_decision:0 "Rejuvenate the Hanyang Arsenal"
QIN_hanyang_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. When the Hanyang Factory started operation, it introduced German rifle technology and mass-produced rifles. The Hanyang Factory had steelmaking and artillery manufacturing equipment from Germany. With these equipment, the Hanyang Factory was able to produce guns, ammunition and their matching gun mounts, becoming one of the few arsenals in China at that time that could produce various types of light and heavy weapons for the arm."

QIN_taiyuan_arsenal_decision:0 "Invest in the Taiyuan Arsenal"
QIN_taiyuan_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Shanxi Military Craft Training Factory could have so much more potential but the personnel, organization, and machinery were very simple. With the prospects of many vital resources such as coal, iron and etc around the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi. It might be wise to build up a local arsenal in Shanxi Province around which would have easy access to the mined resources near the city and its strategic geographical location near Zhili makes delivery easier than for example the arsenal in Lanzhou."

QIN_shenyang_arsenal_decision:0 "Invest in the Shenyang Arsenal"
QIN_shenyang_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "On November 29, 1887, the Ministry of Revenue approved the establishment of a bureau in Fengtian to manufacture arms. On December 5, the proposal was approved. General Yiktang'a of Shengjing was ordered to establish the Fengtian Machinery Bureau, which started in June 1899. It did not manufacture arms, but only minted silver coins. Yet it is impossible to manufacture arms for Fengtian. Through further investments into military production machinery, it is possible to convert the mint into a Military Arsenal as what it was originally planned."

QIN_gongxian_arsenal_decision:0 "Invest in the Gongxian Arsenal"
QIN_gongxian_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "In the search for a location to build a advanced arsenal, experts believed that Xiaoyi Town, Gong County (now Xiaobei and Xiaonan Villages) was the best. ong County is located on the edge of the mountainous area in western Henan and is a strategic location in the Central Plains. It has convenient transportation and rich resources, including iron, coal, refractory materials, purple clay pottery and other minerals. In addition, water resources are also relatively abundant. The location of Gong county is a prime location for the construction of a new advanced military arsenal as a way of expanding our military industrial capbilities."

#  ww1_qing.434.d:0 "While we have completely driven the Tongmenghui off of China, with their leaders fleeing to Japan like the cowardly terrorists they are, it would be naive to believe the troubles are over. Just like when the Han Dynasty put down the Yellow Turban Rebellion, we had to call upon and offer great amounts of autonomy to leaders of local New Armies to defeat the revolution, and our empire has completely fractured. While we remain in power in Beijing, with some influence over these regional lords, we have little control anymore of what happens in the south of our country."

Thought to be exiled in America, Chiang has adopted the name "Zhong Liao", and disguised himself as an ordinary restaurant owner in his hometown. Perhaps he hid this attraction poorly; the restaurant was abbreviated as "KMT".\n\nWhen authorities confronted the location, they were attracted by the delicious smell of fried rice. Instead of detaining Chiang, they instead indulged in a great meal. It had been agreed, in exchange for avoiding political life, that Chiang will be allowed to continue to operate this local business. Afterall, it is a worthy example of mercy for our new state."

He previously served as Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1904–1906 and Viceroy of Liangguang in 1906–1907. He is a pro-foreign official, and is very skilled at governing. He began his career as an army secretary at Li Hongzhang's camp in Anqing, Anhui province during the Taiping Rebellion, who served Li the longest, from 1860 to Li's death in 1901.\n\nThe other candidate is Zhang Zhenfang, a cousin of Yuan Shikai. He was personally recommended by Yuan Shikai to become the governor, but he is not loyal to the dynasty, he is loyal to his corrupt cousin. He is a choice, though.\n\nThe third, and last candidate is Natong. In the first year of Xuantong, he was appointed Minister of Military Aircraft. In 1911, he became an associate minister of the "Royal Cabinet". Choosing him would appease both sides, since he is not pro-Yuan, nor Pro-western.\n\nNow, the fate of Zhili Province will be decided by the Son of Heaven."

According to it, Germany is a federation of 25 states, each with their own limited rights and self-governance, but all under the permanent presidency of Prussia. The title of king of Prussia is synonymous with the title of Kaiser but even he does not govern absolutely. The Bundesrat, Germany's 'upper house' is made up of representatives of the various states, and the Reichstag, Germany's 'lower house', is led by the chancellor who is second only to the Kaiser.\n\nWhile seemingly a strong foundation of democracy, the German constitution in reality still allows for unprecedented levels of power for any constitutional monarch. With the Kaiser being able to appoint the Chancellor, allowing him to dictate what laws are proposed and vetoed in the Reichstag."

#Haldane Mission
ww1_germanrework.83.t: "Germany Invites Viscount Haldane"
ww1_germanrework.83.d: "The German government under the directive of the Pro-British chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, has invited a close friend to our foreign minister, Richard Haldane, to Germany to pursue a diplomatic agreement between the two nations to end the naval race. Opinions in parliament are divided but our government is willing to offer Germany the following terms:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions and, after discussion, would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome."
ww1_germanrework.83.a: "We'll send Haldane to see what happens"
ww1_germanrework.83.b: "We won't negotiate with the Krauts"
ww1_germanrework.84.t: "Britain Refuses Diplomatic Talks"
ww1_germanrework.84.d: "Much to our dismay it seems the British are not interested in negotiation with us. Alas, Admiral Tirpitz has instead convinced the Kaiser to force the Reichstag to pass a new Naval Law as soon as possible to expand the German Navy."
ww1_germanrework.84.a: "They can't say we didn't try!"
ww1_germanrework.85.t: "Britain Sends Viscount Haldane, Tirpitz Demands New Naval Law"
ww1_germanrework.85.d: "Britain has agreed to send Viscount Haldane on a diplomatic mission to Germany. After his arrival, he gave both the government and the Kaiser the following terms of an agreement:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions, and after discussion would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome.\n\nThe Reichstag supported the mission, but Admiral Tirpitz denounced the mission and instead asked the Kaiser to pass a new naval law which would spark an increase in naval tension between the two nations again."
ww1_germanrework.85.a: "We must establish our own navy, pass another naval law"
ww1_germanrework.85.b: "Persuing British neutrality would be a great victory"
ww1_germanrework.86.t: "Germany Announces New Naval Expansion"
ww1_germanrework.86.d: "Soon after Viscount Haldane landed in Germany, the Kaiser had the gall to tour him around the shipyards at Wilhelmshaven and jest about the expansion of the German navy! This insult only hurt more when it was soon announced that the Reichstag would pass a new Naval Law which would expand the German navy even more so. Haldane resigned his offer of treaty soon after this and returned to Britain."
ww1_germanrework.86.a: "Damn Krauts..."
ww1_germanrework.87.t: "Germany Accepts our Treaty"
ww1_germanrework.87.d: "The Prime Minister has happily announced to the nation that an agreement has been signed between Germany and Britain ending the naval race.

With British naval superiority secured, our nation can stand tall once again."

ww1_germanrework.88.d: "Across Europe, the foreign ministries of France and Russia are abuzz with worry. After a period of detente between Britain and Germany, the two nations came to an agreement that recognized Britain's naval supremacy, and in return distanced Britain's presence from the Triple Entente. This agreement could sign that more treaties between the two nations could be signed that would commit Britain to a path of neutrality in a future European conflict."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t: "Strikes in Hamburg"
 ww1_germanrework.3.d: "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."
 ww1_germanrework.3.a: "We must negotiate with the stikers"
ww1_germanrework.4.t: "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
 ww1_germanrework.4.d: "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."
 ww1_germanrework.4.a: "Damn socialists"

#1910 Debate in Prussian Parliment on the "royal civil list"
ww1_germanrework.5.t: "Stormy Debate on the 'Royal Civil List'"
 ww1_germanrework.5.d: "A debate broke out in the Prussian House of Representatives today after the issue of the 'royal civil list' arose, where payments from the state budget to the royal family were to be increased at the request of the Kaiser. The Social Democrat, Adolf Hofmann told the representatives that the Kaiser already received a daily income of 43,065 marks without the proposed increase. This criticism of the rise infuriated the centrists and right-wing of the house, with the President of the House calling Hofmann a 'traitor'. While the increase is still sure to pass the SPD's revisionist wing has been put under scrutiny from the right after their seemingly 'traitorous' stance on the matter."

#1911 Anti-Semitism in the Army
ww1_germanrework.6.t: "The Centre Criticises Anti-Semitism in the Army"
 ww1_germanrework.6.d: "In a notable session of the Reichstag, the Zentrum has voiced its concerns over the increasing antisemitic rhetoric within the German Empire's political discourse. The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."
 ww1_germanrework.6.a: "A matter of some concern..."

#1911 Change to Electoral Law in Grand Duchy of Hesse
ww1_germanrework.7.t: "Change to Electoral Law in Hesse"
 ww1_germanrework.7.d: "In the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the local government has made an amendment to the electoral law that aligns closer with the Prussian system. The law introduces plural voting rights and the direct election of representatives. Accordingly, only male taxpayers over the age of 24 are entitled to vote, but those aged 50 and over receive an additional vote. This is a move to Prussian democracy from Hesse and the amendment has spurred on the SPD cause in the Duchy."

 ww1_germanrework.11.d: "Earlier this week, in the Ruhr region, 170,000 miners left their workplaces to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. As of the moment, the owners of the mines have yet to even attempt to negotiate with the strikes, clearly planning to wait out the strike. The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has come to the support of the strikes, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers, the centrists have already shifted to the right in response, proposing financial aid to the owners of the mines to make up for their losses."

Current deaths are totaled at 115 miners. This follows the strikes in the mines earlier this year and the accident has given the far-left of the Rhur reason to once again begin calling for strikes. Whilst the Kaiser and his people mourn for the dead, a government response to the accident is to be printed in the press soon."

 ww1_germanrework.18.d: "The findings of the national census have been delivered and examined by the administration. After reviewing the findings, a document has been prepared to advise the Reichstag and the Kaiser of the conclusions. These documents have highlighted how large portions of the empire lack vital infrastructure compared to our competitors in Europe, mass urbanization has led to housing shortages and public health growth is minimal - even reverting in some cities. These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."

#1912 Miltary Conferance
ww1_germanrework.20.t: "The Kaiser Calls for a Military Conference"
 ww1_germanrework.20.d: "Meeting at the Stadtschloss in Berlin, the Kaiser has called a military conference between the highest military leaders in the German Empire. It's expected that the topics of discussion will follow the tense military and diplomatic situation in Europe. Specific topics will naturally focus on Russia's 'Great Military Plan', Austria-Hungary's concerns about Serbian military action, and the relationship of the Empire with the British.\n\nKnown attendees include Tirpitz, Muller, Molkte, and Heeringen, with an equally strong presence from the Army and the Navy.\n\nAs preparations and talks about Germany's place in a war in Europe, each day brings war closer to the Reich and do doubt, soon legislature will be passed to expand the German armed forces to meet a new era of war."
 ww1_germanrework.20.a: "A major war is on the horizon"

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t: "Wilhelmine Germany"
 ww1_germanrework.21.d: "The dawn of Wilhelmine Germany marked a new era of industrial prowess and ambitious imperialism under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II - ascending to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm II sought to propel Germany into the ranks of global superpowers, adopting a policy of Weltpolitik to expand German influence and secure a 'place in the sun.'\n\nThe economy flourished with rapid industrialization throughout the second industrial revolution, making Germany a leader in steel production, chemicals, and electrical engineering. This industrial boom fostered a burgeoning middle class and significant urbanization, transforming the societal landscape. This allowed Wilhelm to sanction the expansion of the German navy under admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, reflecting his aspirations for a formidable maritime presence to rival that of Great Britain.\n\nInternally, during the Wilhelmine period Germany witnessed the rise of the Social Democratic Party, representing the growing working class and advocating for more radical social reforms. This rise of the left poses challenges to the conservative establishment, necessitating a delicate balance between modernization and maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nOn the international stage, Germany's assertive foreign policy aimed at colonial expansion and securing alliances created tensions with other European powers - something that has led Germany to become diplomatically isolated and even 'encircled' by the triple entente. However, the formation of the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy still stands and in those two powers, Germany still has some friends left within the content.\n\nFor now, Wilhelmine Germany stands as a testament to the industrial strength of Germany, and her resolve through the many crises she has, and will, face."
 ww1_germanrework.21.a: "Germany sails a steady course"

#Socialism in Germany
ww1_germanrework.22.t: "Socialism in the German Empire"
 ww1_germanrework.22.d: "Since the unification of Germany; 1877, the SPD has grown in popularity exponentially. Unlike the right wing of the Reichstag, the left is mostly unified under the SPD with both moderate social democrats and revisionist republicans holding seats for the party's faction. However, the FVp's faction in the Reichstag also holds significant sway in the leftist wing.\n\nOutside of the Reichstag the workers of Germany are significantly unionized under moderate worker's unions - as of late the unions have become more and more restless, and working conditions in the industries have slowly declined with Germany's rise in demand. If not dealt with properly the unions have the power to cripple the economy, the government's saving grace is that the unions are decentralized without a common purpose, allowing the chancellor to make slower reforms that won't upset either the balance of power or the right-wing of the Reichstag."

#The Fleeting Right-Wing
ww1_germanrework.23.t: "The Fleeting Right-Wing"
 ww1_germanrework.23.d: "Germany's right wing has always been favored by both the aristocracy and farmers, composed of conservative, agricultural, and nationalist parties. However, the decline of right-wing has become more and more clear as the second industrial revolution catalyzed the formation of leftist unions and bolstered support for the Social Democrats. Due to this many of the conservative parties have begun to adapt their policies to ensure they can keep their key voter's support; the conservatives continue to advocate for a self-sufficient economy less reliant on trade, especially with nations like Britain who pose a threat to German ambitions and the agriculturists call for tax exemptions for farmers to give them the support they need to feed the newly urbanized populations. If the right-wing is to revive itself it must set a clear goal that the rightist parties can follow, or else the right will be crushed under the tide of social democracy."

##1914 The Royal Approval of Frankfurt university
ww1_germanrework.24.t: "The Founding of Frankfurt University"
 ww1_germanrework.24.d: "The University of Frankfurt on Main was established on September 28th, 1912, when the foundation for forming the university was passed by Frankfurt's city government. It has it's roots in Goethe University, which was established in 1484, but was not officially considered to be one under German customs, as it did not issue degrees for almost half a millennia. Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."

 ww1_germanrework.25.d: "Albert Einstein, the renowned theoretical physicist, was recently offered a job as the director of the new Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, as well as membership in the Prussian Academy of Science and the Humboldt Academy of Berlin in order to be funded to conduct research. Max Planck - a theoretical physicist who served as president of the German Physical Institute from 1905 to 1909, and creator of Planck's Constant - and Walther Nernst - friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II and thermodynamic physicist - convinced Einstein to take these jobs. He settled in Dahlem on April 1st, 1914."

#Formation of the OHL
ww1_germanrework.40.t: "Formation of the OHL"
 ww1_germanrework.40.d: "After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Prussian Army, Royal Saxon Army, Army of Württemberg and the Bavarian Army were autonomous in peacetime, each kingdom maintaining a separate war ministry and general staff to administer their forces. On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire ensures that the German Emperor would be made commander-in-chief of the combined armies.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Oberste Heeresleitung is now the highest echelon of command of the Heer of the German Empire, led by general Moltke. The OHL is split into sections that will take control over different parts of the country, whilst also monitoring politics and taking over the economy to ensure production remains most efficient for the army.\n\nIn addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consists of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers. "

#The Centre Block
ww1_germanrework.41.t: "The Centre Block"
 ww1_germanrework.41.d: "The Centre of Germany has been the dominant force in the Empire's governing politics since its creation. The centrists are led by the trusted Zentrum party who formed in 1870, went on to successfully battle against the Kulturkampf waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. However, there are plenty of centrist parties in Germany who seek to make moderate social reform whilst ensuring that German traditional values are kept.\n\nIf Germany is going to continue to be stable throughout the next decade, the centrists must keep their power in Germany so that a moderate amount of rightist and leftist laws are passed into the bundesrat. Luckily, many of the key political figures in Germany, like Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, support the centrists and have aided them in keeping their majority in the Reichstag. "

#The Growing Pan-German Influence
ww1_germanrework.42.t: "The Matter of the Pan-Germans"
 ww1_germanrework.42.d: "Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein their goals were never truly achieved. After the unification, from the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, who since 1891 were organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, even calling for the annexation of Austria. The organization has greatly supported the educated middle and upper class; promoting German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, "Deutsche Politik" (1905-07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe which many of the League have taken to heart.\n\nHowever, since the dawn of this new millennium, the Pan-Germans have taken a moderate stance to Austria, instead focusing on annexations in Russia and France. It seems for now the Pan-Germans have abandoned the annexationist policy around Austria."

#Adressing the matter of the German Identity
ww1_germanrework.43.t: "A 'German' Empire"
 ww1_germanrework.43.d: "Since the Frankfurt Parliament's creation, the issue of 'German' land occupied by Poles has been a forefront issue of the nation's claims. Whilst we have begun Germanisation efforts in the areas of the empire occupied by Danes and Poles, there is still a silent cultural resistance against our rule in these areas. This issue of minorities on German land has led to conflicts on how the minorities should be treated by the government, currently Polish and Danish minorities can apply for German citizenship, but some centrists and leftists, including Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg want to expand the rights of minorities to ensure they can claim the same insurances and state benefits than any other German citizens can. On the other hand, the rightist factions in the Reichstag have instead proposed that minority citizenship have their 'perks' reduced to allow the government to use more fund towards the betterment of 'real' Germans."

There have been four naval expansion bills under Kaiser Wilhelm II and it's likely that Tirpitz will try to pass a fifth.\n\nThe Navy stands strong but if we truly want to challenge Britain's naval dominance, we will need to invest far more into our naval production to match their might."

Moltke is set to recover but will no longer be fit to serve in the army under any capacity. He has been immediately 'retired' by the Kaiser who has selected Falkenhayn as the new Chief. Wilhelm and the general staff hope that Falkenhayn's more realistic approach to the war will help Germany to make gains on the Eastern front and perhaps even commit to a breakthrough in France."

 ww1_germanrework.47.d: "Contrary to Falkenhayn's expectations, the Entente was able to limit casualties in the divisions sent to the front. The procession of divisions back and forth was analogous to the operation of a "noria", a type of water wheel that continuously lifts water and empties it into a trough which allowed the entente to scupper Falkenhayn's plan.\n\nOn top of this, both Hindenburg and Ludendorff have made clear they will resign from their positions unless Falkenhayn is removed and Hindenburg appointed head of the OHL using his failures to achieve their ambitions, the Kaiser if left with no choice but to accept."

The press reports that Forstner told his soldiers, 'If you are attacked, then make use of your weapon; if you stab such a Wackes in the process, then you'll get ten marks from me.' This event has been multiplied in severity by the media causing the local population to protest strongly against this treatment by the German military in the next few days."

Unfortunately, unimpressed by these actions, the Alsatian public continued to protest. As a further provocation, Lieutenant Forstner was reported to go out and aggravate the public after having his punishment repealed.

As if matters couldn't have gotten worse, not only has the press been alerted that Wilhelm was practically forced to leave his hunting vacation at Donauschingen to deal with the crisis by his own wife, but they are now also publishing papers that criticise the Kaiser for seemingly only heeding the viewpoint of the military - even excluding the chancellor from meetings.\n\nChancellor von Hollweg has now been put into a tricky position by the Kaiser, it is his constitutional duty to support the Kaiser in all affairs and placate the Reichstag in his name. However, the Reichstag are beginning to call for a censure vote where they will show their disproval to the Kaiser by recommending that he replaces his chancellor - as is their right.

 ww1_germanrework.76.d: "Despite intense mobilization by our army, we have not managed to take control of Verdun-sur-Meuse. In addition to being a strategic artery, the region is fortified, which would have opened the door to a broader offensive from which we will not be able to take advantage."

#Focuses

#Starting Political Tree
GER_wilhelmine_germany: "The Wilhelmine Era"
GER_wilhelmine_germany_desc: "Since Kaiser Wilhelm II's ascension to the throne in 1888, a new era has dawned in Germany. While the Kaiser's dismissal of Bismarck's careful diplomacy has led to increasing tensions with Britain and Russia, his domestic policies have shown a more progressive intent. Wilhelm's support for workers' rights and opposition to Bismarck's anti-socialist laws have earned him some popular support. Above all, the Kaiser dreams of expanding Germany's colonial empire and securing the nation's rightful 'place in the sun.'"
GER_freie_volksbuhne: "Die Freie Volksbühne"
GER_freie_volksbuhne_desc: "Founded in 1890 by Bruno Wille, 'Die Freie Volksbühne' (The People's Free Theater) represents a triumph of social democratic culture despite the Anti-Socialist Laws. This workers' theater brings art to the proletariat and serves as a reminder that even under political repression, the social democratic movement endures. While the Kaiser's government may rest easy, we Social Democrats will demonstrate that change is not merely possible - it is inevitable."
GER_appoint_solf_as_colonial_secretary: "Appoint Solf as Colonial Secretary"
GER_appoint_solf_as_colonial_secretary_desc: "Dr. Wilhelm Solf, an experienced colonial administrator with liberal leanings, represents an ideal replacement for our current Colonial Secretary. His pragmatic approach emphasizes cultural assimilation and improved living standards in the colonies rather than brutal suppression. This appointment would satisfy both conservative and liberal factions, as Solf's methods promise stability without sacrificing efficiency."
GER_productional_efficiency: "Ruthless Colonial Exploitation"
GER_productional_efficiency_desc: "Despite Colonial Secretary Solf's preference for measured policies, pressure from industrial interests demands more aggressive exploitation of our colonial resources. By expanding industrial facilities and intensifying resource extraction, we can significantly increase output - though such measures will likely provoke local resistance and increase the risk of sabotage. The promise of greater profits must be weighed against the cost of maintaining order."
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposits: "Nationalize Colonial Diamond Deposits"
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposits_desc: "The diamond deposits in German South-West Africa represent immense potential wealth, yet private companies have proven inefficient in their exploitation. Following Colonial Secretary Solf's recommendations for increased efficiency, we shall establish a state-controlled organization to manage these valuable resources directly."
GER_deal_with_the_sokehs_rebellion: "Suppress the Sokehs Rebellion"
GER_deal_with_the_sokehs_rebellion_desc: "The rebellion on Pohnpei must be crushed decisively. We shall dispatch naval forces and troops to restore order on the island, whether through arrest of the ringleaders or more forceful measures if necessary. The authority of the German Empire cannot be challenged in our Pacific territories."
GER_organise_german_settlement: "Promote Colonial Settlement"
GER_organise_german_settlement_desc: "The success of our colonial mission requires a strong German presence in our overseas territories. By organizing systematic settlement programs, we can establish communities of German settlers who will serve as cultural bridges. Through daily interaction and commerce, the native populations will naturally gravitate toward German customs and values."
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies: "Congo Basin Cooperation"
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies_desc: "The Belgian Congo's vast mineral wealth presents an opportunity for mutual benefit. By establishing partnerships with Belgian companies operating along our colonial borders, we can develop more efficient resource extraction methods and secure a share of the region's prosperity for the Reich."
GER_finance_the_east_african_railway_project: "East African Railway Initiative"
GER_finance_the_east_african_railway_project_desc: "Colonial Secretary Solf has presented plans for an ambitious railway network in German East Africa. This infrastructure project will not only revolutionize civilian transport but also address the critical issue of military logistics in the region, ensuring our forces can maintain effective control over these vast territories."
GER_healthcare_reforms: "Healthcare Reforms"
GER_healthcare_reforms_desc: "The rapid industrialization of our cities has created pockets of unemployment and social disruption. This comprehensive legislation will establish mechanisms to direct labor where it is most needed, particularly in our growing industrial sectors. The act will help manage the challenges of urbanization while ensuring economic efficiency."
GER_hausarbeitsgesetz: "Hausarbeitsgesetz"
GER_hausarbeitsgesetz_desc: "The "Household Tasks Act" is the first form of recognition for homeworkers. Contrary to what its name suggests, this proposed regulation affects all homeworkers, such as artisans or sculptors. It regulates the safety, status, and payment of these workers."
GER_conduct_a_national_census: "Imperial Census Initiative"
GER_conduct_a_national_census_desc: "A thorough census of the Reich is essential for modern governance. While the data may reveal concerning trends in our urban centers, it will provide crucial information for policy-making. The financial cost is justified by the valuable insights we will gain into our nation's demographic and social conditions."
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension: "Bethmann-Hollweg's Pension Reform"
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension_desc: "Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg has proposed comprehensive reforms to the Reich's pension system. His plan would increase benefits and extend coverage to ethnic minorities within the empire. While conservatives denounce the inclusion of non-Germans in the system, these reforms would stimulate consumer spending and promote social stability."
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives: "Agricultural Modernization Program"
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives_desc: "The migration to urban centers has left our agricultural sector struggling with labor shortages. Through a system of targeted grants, we can encourage both the adoption of modern farming equipment and the retention of agricultural workers. This program will ensure our farming communities remain productive despite demographic changes."
GER_the_reich_to_bavaria_railway: "Berlin-Munich Railway"
GER_the_reich_to_bavaria_railway_desc: "The Prussian State Railways has proposed a new direct rail link between Berlin and Munich. This project will not only stimulate commerce between northern and southern Germany but also strengthen Bavaria's integration into the Reich. As our second-largest state, Bavaria's continued commitment to the empire is paramount."
GER_a_constitution_for_alsace: "Constitution for Elsass-Lothringen"
GER_a_constitution_for_alsace_desc: "Since its return to German rule in 1871, Alsace-Lorraine has been administered as Reichsland under direct imperial authority. The time has come to grant it full status as a federal state, complete with representation in the Bundesrat. This reform will demonstrate our commitment to proper integration of these historic German lands."
GER_german_peoples_get_german_pensions: "Germans-Only Pension Policy"
GER_german_peoples_get_german_pensions_desc: "Bethmann-Hollweg's proposal to extend pensions to non-Germans is an affront to the Reich's fundamental character. While we shall enhance pension benefits, they must remain the exclusive privilege of German citizens. The state's resources should serve to strengthen the German people first and foremost."
GER_memories_of_1871: "The Legacy of 1871"
GER_memories_of_1871_desc: "The proclamation of the German Empire in 1871 marked the culmination of Bismarck's vision of unification through 'blood and iron.' While the Reichstag may host various parties, true power remains firmly in the hands of the conservative establishment - the Junker aristocracy, the military leadership, and industrial magnates. This right-wing dominance continues to shape imperial policy."
GER_treading_the_centre_line: "Politik der Mitte"
GER_treading_the_centre_line_desc: "In these turbulent times, Germany must maintain a careful balance between competing interests. Only through measured, pragmatic policies can we unite our nation against external threats while preserving domestic stability. The path forward lies in careful moderation and strategic compromise."
GER_the_growing_pan_german_influence: "Rise of the Pan-German League"
GER_the_growing_pan_german_influence_desc: "The Alldeutscher Verband, though relatively small in membership, wields considerable influence among our political and intellectual elite. Their vision of uniting all German-speaking peoples under one flag resonates with growing nationalist sentiments. While radical, their ideas increasingly shape discussions about Germany's future."

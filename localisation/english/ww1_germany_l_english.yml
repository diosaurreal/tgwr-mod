GER_idea_bismarksche_reichsverassung_desc: "Bismarck's Imperial Constitution (Bismarcksche Reichsverfassung), enacted following the Franco-Prussian War, forms the legal bedrock of the German Empire. It unites 25 German states in a federation under the hereditary presidency of the Prussian King, who also bears the title of German Kaiser. While the Bundesrat represents the states and the Reichstag is elected by universal male suffrage, the Kaiser's power to appoint the Chancellor allows him significant influence over legislation, maintaining a strong monarchical character within the constitutional system."

GER_home_by_christmas: "Home by Christmas?"
GER_home_by_christmas_desc: "Our major offensive against France has not produced the expected results, and the Western Front is still resisting.

GER_idea_germany_encircled: "Einkreisungstheorie"
GER_idea_germany_encircled_desc: "The prevalent §YEinkreisungstheorie§! (Encirclement Theory) argues Germany is strategically encircled: France seeking revanche to the west, the Russian Empire to the east, and British naval power from the north, limiting our reach. This perceived threat is compounded by the unreliability of our Austrian ally, exposing our southern flank. Proponents view this Entente encirclement as an existential danger to our lands and industrial might. All actions must therefore aim to break this strategic bind and ensure the security of the German Empire.\n\nBy any means necessary..."

GER_rapid_urbanisation: "Rapid Urbanization"
GER_rapid_urbanisation_desc: "The explosive growth of German industry has led to a mass exodus from rural areas, transforming our cities almost overnight. While new factories rise at an unprecedented pace, our infrastructure struggles to keep up with this breakneck expansion.

#Events
#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t: "Germany's Disgrace"
ww1_germanrework.1.d: "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Bethmann Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."
ww1_germanrework.1.a: "Bethmann Hollweg should stay."
ww1_germanrework.1.b: "The Kaiser pressures Bethmann Hollweg to resign."
ww1_germanrework.2.t: "The Kaiser Appoints von Heydebrand"
ww1_germanrework.2.d: "In a bold and decisive move, Kaiser Wilhelm II has appointed Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa as the new Chancellor of the German Empire. A figure renowned for his staunch conservatism and unwavering dedication to the Prussian ideals, von Heydebrand's ascent marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the empire.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Ernst von Heydebrand has long been a prominent voice in the German Conservative Party. His career has been characterized by a fervent advocacy for the preservation of traditional German values and institutions. A fierce opponent of liberalism and socialism, von Heydebrand has consistently championed policies that strengthen the monarchy, the military, and the agrarian interests that form the backbone of his support.\n\nVon Heydebrand's tenure is expected to usher in an era of intensified conservative governance. With a reputation for his iron will and unyielding principles, he is anticipated to reinforce the Kaiser's vision of a strong, unified Germany, poised to assert its influence on the European stage. However, his appointment is not without controversy, as it risks deepening the divides within the Reichstag and among the populace, who are increasingly restless with the status quo."
ww1_germanrework.2.a: "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t: "Factions on the Right"
ww1_germanrework.19.d: "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like Bethmann Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."
ww1_germanrework.19.a: "The Chancellor should tread with care."

#Potsdam Meeting
ww1_germanrework.89.t: "Meeting at Potsdam"
ww1_germanrework.89.d: "We received an invitation from the German government this morning, requesting the Tsar's presence at a meeting with Kaiser Wilhelm in Potsdam. The stated agenda concerned our respective spheres of influence in Persia. Seeing little disadvantage in discussions, the Tsar agreed to meet his German cousin.\n\nThe meeting was cordial and representatives between the two sides found themselves often agreeing with each other on Middle Eastern foreign policy. However, the atmosphere shifted when the German delegation proposed a formal, public declaration that neither Empire would undertake hostile actions against the other. Faced with this unexpected demand for a non-aggression pact, no formal agreement could be reached between our two nations."
ww1_germanrework.89.a: "They took it a step too far."
ww1_germanrework.90.t: "Disappointment at Potsdam"
ww1_germanrework.90.d: "The Russian Tsar and his delegates met with the Kaiser at Potsdam. Throughout the entire event, the whole affair seemed rather cordial with many delegates agreeing on matters of foreign policy in the Middle East. The two cousins, Wilhelm and Nicolas also seemed to be getting along well. However, despite this positive start, the talks ultimately collapsed. Our proposal for a mutual declaration of non-aggression, intended to secure peace between our empires, proved unacceptable to the Russians. Consequently, no formal agreement was signed, and the delegations departed with a sense of missed opportunity. Perhaps future circumstances will allow for renewed dialogue between Germany and Russia."
ww1_germanrework.90.a: "At least we agree on something."

ww1_germanrework.91.t: "Renewal of the Triple Alliance"
ww1_germanrework.91.d: "The renewal of the Triple Alliance was a diplomatic process involving Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary; this event was an opportunity for allies to meet in Vienna. Germany was represented by Gottlieb von Jagow, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Austria-Hungary sent its Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold. Italy was represented by Antonino di San Giuliano, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nDuring this discreet conference, the three allies discussed spheres of influence in North Africa, but also mutual guarantees that in the event of war, no party would make a separate peace. Beyond simply reviving central cooperation, this event was an opportunity to reiterate each party's commitment to the Triple Alliance."
ww1_germanrework.91.a: "A tedious necessity."
ww1_germanrework.91.b: "Let us hope it is enough to contain Russia."
ww1_germanrework.91.c: "We must reconcile Italian and Austrian ambitions!"
ww1_germanrework.91.e: "Excellent."

ww1_germanrework.92.t: "German Consortium Ownership on Seara and Minerva Newspapers"
ww1_germanrework.92.d: "While we are waging war against the Central Powers, we discover with some astonishment that the newspapers of the conservative Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești were sold to a German consortium. The consequence is direct: These newspapers are now spreading propaganda in favor of the Central Powers, which is destabilizing our war effort."
ww1_germanrework.92.a: "Shut them down!"

ww1_germanrework.93.t: "German Consortium Ownership on Slovo and Otechestvo Newspaper"
ww1_germanrework.93.d: "While we are waging war against the Central Powers, we discover with some astonishment that the newspapers of the conservative Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești have been sold to a German consortium. The consequence is direct: These newspapers are now spreading propaganda in favor of the Central Powers, which is destabilizing our war effort."
ww1_germanrework.93.a: "Shut them down!"

ww1_germanrework.94.t: "The Dutch AG Vulcan Contract"
ww1_germanrework.94.d: "Netherlands has signed a contract with AG Vulcan to build four V-105-class torpedo boats, designated 105, 106, 107, and 108. We could take advantage of our relations with them to freeze the delivery of the ships, and then requisition them in the event of a major conflict..."
ww1_germanrework.94.a: "Freeze the transaction. The ships are ours."
ww1_germanrework.94.b: "Honor the contract. Sell them the ships."

ww1_germanrework.95.t: "Germany Freezes One of our Naval Contract"
ww1_germanrework.95.d: "We had signed a contract with the firm AG Vulcan for the construction of four V-105 class torpedo boats, named HNLMS Z 1, HNLMS Z 2, HNLMS Z 3, and HNLMS Z 4. However, just as construction was due to be completed, we were informed that the ships could not be delivered to us for an indefinite period. It is likely that the German government intervened and prohibited the transfer of the ships, probably out of fear that we were at war.\n\nThe very idea that they are considering the matter demonstrates the lack of consideration they have for us."
ww1_germanrework.95.a: "Outrageous!"

ww1_germanrework.96.t: "AG Vulcan Delivers New Ships"
ww1_germanrework.96.d: "We had signed a contract with AG Vulcan for the construction of four V-105-class torpedo boats, named HNLMS Z 1, HNLMS Z 2, HNLMS Z 3, and HNLMS Z 4. The German manufacturer AG Vulcan informed us that the ships' preparation was complete, and they were then returned to us in [ROOT.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for service in the Baltic Navy."
ww1_germanrework.96.a: "Excellent!"

ww1_germanrework.97.t: "German Offer of Industrial Support"
ww1_germanrework.97.d: "Our German ally has offered us increased industrial, military, and technological aid to help us develop our war industry. In addition to providing low-interest loans, they are also offering the assistance of their advisors and the transfer of patents to facilitate the modernization of our industry. While such an offer may seem charitable, it risks making us a satellite of the German Empire, if that wasn't already the case..."
ww1_germanrework.97.a: "We need all the help we can get!"
ww1_germanrework.97.b: "We can manage on our own."

ww1_germanrework.98.t: "Austrian Cooperation"
ww1_germanrework.98.d: "As we anticipated, Austria has been cooperative and accepted our assistance, which will certainly accelerate the development of their war industry."
ww1_germanrework.98.a: "Good."

ww1_germanrework.99.t: "Austrian Defiance"
ww1_germanrework.99.d: "To our great surprise, Austria-Hungary has flatly refused our offer of aid, stating that their economic program is already flourishing and that they remain an independent power. This unexpected display of pride is concerning."
ww1_germanrework.99.a: "Their loss."

ww1_germanrework.100.t: "Improved Military and R&D Cooperation"
ww1_germanrework.100.d: "German military experts met with us to discuss the potential of our Skoda company in the construction of heavy guns. They expressed interest in our Skoda 305mm super-heavy mortars. These anti-fortress artillery pieces have proven extremely effective in initial trials, and some of their feedback has allowed work to begin on improving the rotating pivot. In order to increase the range, a second project to enlarge the barrel is also being considered, giving this weapon the potential of a very long-range howitzer."
ww1_germanrework.100.a: "We might make great use of it."

ww1_germanrework.101.t: "Appointing a New Colonial Secretary"
ww1_germanrework.101.d: "The vacancy in the Reichskolonialamt (Imperial Colonial Office) requires us to select a new State Secretary, a choice that will significantly shape the governance of our overseas territories. Two distinct paths lie before us, embodied by the leading candidates:\n\nWilhelm Solf represents the reformist wing. A diplomat experienced in colonial administration, he advocates for a more conciliatory policy, seeking to improve efficiency and potentially ease tensions with colonial populations through administrative reforms rather than force.\n\nIn stark contrast, Eduard von Liebert champions a hardline, militaristic approach. A former governor with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong connections to nationalist and Pan-German circles, he favours asserting unwavering German dominance and pursuing aggressive colonial exploitation, regardless of the human cost. His appointment would signal a commitment to forceful expansion and control."
ww1_germanrework.101.a: "We need Solf's reforms."
ww1_germanrework.101.b: "Von Liebert will assert our dominance."

ww1_germanrework.102.t: "Ermächtigungsgesetz"
ww1_germanrework.102.d: "To allow the empire to finance the war by any means necessary, Parliament passed a law authorizing the introduction of exceptional measures dictated by the government. The Kaiser and the OHL can thus govern by decree, which facilitates war legislation and offers us many perspectives. Beyond these celebrations, it is important to note that Parliament can withdraw this exceptional authorization at any time, which would be a catastrophe for the war effort."
ww1_germanrework.102.a: "The coalition must hold the line!"

ww1_germanrework.175.t: "Hilfsdienstgesetz"
ww1_germanrework.175.d: "To achieve the total mobilization required by the Hindenburg Programme, the Supreme Army Command has pushed the Auxiliary Service Act through the Reichstag. The new law grants the state sweeping powers to direct all civilian labour towards the war effort. However, this authority came at a steep political price. To secure the assent of the socialists and their powerful trade unions, we were forced to grant them formal recognition and mandate the creation of worker arbitration committees. While this has secured industrial peace for now, it has also massively empowered the very groups who may yet turn against the war."
ww1_germanrework.175.a: "A necessary, if dangerous, compromise."

ww1_germanrework.103.d: "German Chancellor Theodor von Bethmann Hollweg traveled to Vienna to negotiate a concession plan aimed at permanently easing the icy Austro-Italian relations. Aware of our army's difficulties, the minister offered to exchange his own territory if we agreed to accede to Italy's demands.\n\nIn other words, we could offer Tyrol and receive Silesia in exchange. This proposal is very attractive; Silesia is an industrialized territory and composed of German speakers, which is to our advantage."

The Austro-Hungarian Empire seems serious about its approach and has offered to cede part of its territory—that is, the entirety of Tyrol—in exchange for the restoration of friendly relations between the two nations. More formally, this would prevent us from declaring war on them, at the very least."

ww1_germanrework.83.d: "The German government under the directive of the pro-British Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, has invited his close friend ViscountRichard Haldane, to Germany to pursue a diplomatic agreement between the two nations to end the naval race. Opinions in Parliament are divided but our government is willing to offer Germany the following terms:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions and, after discussion, would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome."

After his arrival, he gave both the government and the Kaiser the following terms of an agreement:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions, and after discussion would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome.\n\nThe Reichstag supported the mission, but Admiral Tirpitz denounced the mission and instead asked the Kaiser to pass a new naval law which would spark an increase in naval tension between the two nations again."

This insult only hurt more when it was soon announced that the Reichstag would pass a new Naval Law which would expand the German navy even more so. Haldane resigned his offer of treaty soon after this and returned to Britain."

After a period of detente between Britain and Germany, the two nations came to an agreement that recognized Britain's naval supremacy, and in return distanced Britain's presence from the Triple Entente.

ww1_germanrework.45.d: "Debate rages in the Reichstag over the new federal budget. With rising demands from industry, workers, and the military, Germany must now choose how to prioritize its resources. Liberals and social reformers call for investment in welfare, infrastructure, and education. Conservatives and the officer corps demand higher military spending and colonial expansion. The path we choose will shape the Empire's future."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t: "Strikes in Hamburg"
ww1_germanrework.3.d: "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."
ww1_germanrework.3.a: "We must negotiate with the stikers."
ww1_germanrework.4.t: "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
ww1_germanrework.4.d: "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."
ww1_germanrework.4.a: "Damned socialists."

#1910 Debate in Prussian Parliment on the "royal civil list"
ww1_germanrework.5.t: "Stormy Debate on the Royal Civil List"
ww1_germanrework.5.d: "A heated debate erupted today in the Prussian Landtag (House of Representatives) when the issue of the 'Royal Civil List' was raised. At the Kaiser's request, payments from the state budget to the royal family are proposed to be increased.\n\nDuring the debate, the Social Democrat representative Adolph Hoffmann stated before the assembly that the Kaiser already enjoys a daily income of 43,065 Marks, even without the proposed increase. This pointed criticism provoked outrage among the Centrist and Right-wing factions of the house. The President of the Landtag even went so far as to denounce Hofmann as a 'traitor'.\n\nWhile the increase itself is almost certain to pass, the incident has subjected the SPD's revisionist wing to heightened scrutiny from the right, questioning their loyalty after this seemingly 'traitorous' stance."
ww1_germanrework.5.a: "Hoffmann is right. The Kaiser requires no further funds!"
ww1_germanrework.5.b: "Damn the traitors! The Kaiser deserves our loyalty!"

#1911 Anti-Semitism in the Army
ww1_germanrework.6.t: "The Centre Criticises Anti-Semitism in the Army"
ww1_germanrework.6.d: "In a notable session of the Reichstag, the Zentrum has voiced its concerns over the increasing antisemitic rhetoric within the German Empire's political discourse. The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."
ww1_germanrework.6.a: "A matter of some concern..."

#1911 Change to Electoral Law in Grand Duchy of Hesse
ww1_germanrework.7.t: "Electoral Reform in Hesse"
ww1_germanrework.7.d: "The Grand Duchy of Hesse has reformed its electoral law. While the old system of census suffrage based on wealth has been abolished, it has been replaced by a system of plural voting which grants a second vote to all male citizens over the age of fifty. This conservative compromise, designed to counterbalance the effect of a broader franchise, has been condemned by the Social Democrats. The move has only strengthened their campaign for true, equal suffrage."

ww1_germanrework.8.d: "The British government has sent a delegation here to [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in the hopes of signing a mutual arms production limitation pact. England is indeed seeking to limit tensions in Europe, which naturally involves reducing military escalation in the region. Such a pact could make us look good to the British, while redirecting some of our budget elsewhere... However, we cannot be certain that a war will not break out, one way or another."

ww1_germanrework.11.d: "Earlier this week, in the Ruhr region, 170,000 miners left their workplaces to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. As of now, the owners of the mines have yet to even attempt to negotiate with the strikes, clearly planning to wait out the strike. The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has voiced its support for the strikers, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers. In response, the Centre Party has shifted to the right, proposing financial aid to the mine owners to compensate for their losses."
ww1_germanrework.11.a: "We shall not negotiate with the unions."
ww1_germanrework.11.b: "For the greater good, we should negotiate."

#1912 Ruhr Accident
ww1_germanrework.12.t: "Mining Accident in the Ruhr"
ww1_germanrework.12.d: "A solum day for the Reich, Kaiser Wilhelm recently visited the scene of a mining accident in the Ruhr region to pay respects to the deceased miners. Current deaths are totaled at 115 miners. This follows the strikes in the mines earlier this year and the accident has given the far-left of the Rhur reason to once again begin calling for strikes. Whilst the Kaiser and his people mourn for the dead, a government response to the accident is to be printed in the press soon."
ww1_germanrework.12.a: "A sad day for the Reich."

#National Census

ww1_germanrework.18.d: "The findings of the national census have been delivered and examined by the administration. After reviewing the findings, a document has been prepared to advise the Reichstag and the Kaiser of the conclusions. These documents have highlighted how large portions of the empire lack vital infrastructure compared to our competitors in Europe, mass urbanization has led to housing shortages and public health growth is minimal - even reverting in some cities. These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."

#1912 Miltary Conferance
ww1_germanrework.20.t: "The Kaiser Calls for a War Council"
ww1_germanrework.20.d: "Meeting at the Stadtschloss in Berlin, the Kaiser has called a War Council between the highest military leaders in the German Empire. It's expected that the topics of discussion will follow the tense military and diplomatic situation in Europe. Specific topics will naturally focus on Russia's 'Great Military Plan', Austria-Hungary's concerns about Serbian military action, and the relationship of the Empire with the British.\n\nKnown attendees include Tirpitz, Muller, Molkte, and Heeringen, with an equally strong presence from the Army and the Navy.\n\nAs preparations and talks about Germany's place in a war in Europe, each day brings war closer to the Reich and do doubt, soon legislature will be passed to expand the German armed forces to meet a new era of war."
ww1_germanrework.20.a: "A major war is on the horizon."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t: "Wilhelmine Germany"
ww1_germanrework.21.d: "Ascending to the throne in 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm II ushered in an era defined by surging national ambition and industrial might. Fueled by intense nationalism and a belief in military strength, [GER.GetNameDef]'s pursuit of Weltpolitik - seeking global influence and a 'place in the sun' - drives its actions on the world stage.\n\nRapid industrialization has transformed [GER.GetNameDef] into an economic powerhouse, reshaping its society in the process. This economic power fuels Admiral von Tirpitz's ambitious naval expansion, aimed at challenging British sea power.\n\nDomestically, the rise of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), championing the interests of the burgeoning working class, creates internal political friction with the conservative establishment.\n\nExternally, the quest for global influence has led [GER.GetNameDef] to discard Bismarck's careful web of alliances in favour of the 'Politik der freien Hand' (Policy of the Free Hand). This assertive approach, prioritising diplomatic flexibility over established commitments, has heightened tensions with other European powers and contributed to a sense of 'encirclement' by the Triple Entente. Nevertheless, the Triple Alliance with [AUS.GetNameDef] and [ITA.GetNameDef] remains a crucial counterbalance.\n\nPowerful and ambitious, Wilhelmine Germany faces a challenging future, beset by internal discord and international tensions."
ww1_germanrework.21.a: "Germany sails a steady course."

#Socialism in Germany
ww1_germanrework.22.t: "Social Democracy in the German Empire"
ww1_germanrework.22.d: "The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has grown significantly since unification, dominating the political left in the Reichstag alongside the Progressive People's Party (FVP). This rise is mirrored by the increasing power of trade unions, fueled by German industrial expansion.\n\nHowever, declining working conditions amid soaring production demands have led to growing unrest among unionised workers. While currently decentralized and lacking unified leadership, these unions hold the potential to cripple the economy if their grievances are ignored. The government must tread carefully, balancing concessions to labour with the need to placate powerful conservative forces within the Reichstag and the establishment."
ww1_germanrework.22.a: "The demands of the socialists must not distract us."

#The Fleeting Right-Wing
ww1_germanrework.23.t: "The Fleeting Right-Wing"
ww1_germanrework.23.d: "Germany's right wing has always been favored by both the aristocracy and farmers, composed of conservative, agricultural, and nationalist parties. However, the decline of right-wing has become more and more clear as the second industrial revolution catalyzed the formation of leftist unions and bolstered support for the Social Democrats. Due to this many of the conservative parties have begun to adapt their policies to ensure they can keep their key voter's support; the conservatives continue to advocate for a self-sufficient economy less reliant on trade, especially with nations like Britain who pose a threat to German ambitions and the agriculturists call for tax exemptions for farmers to give them the support they need to feed the newly urbanized populations. If the right-wing is to revive itself it must set a clear goal that the rightist parties can follow, or else the right will be crushed under the tide of social democracy."
ww1_germanrework.23.a: "Perhaps the right can still be revived..."

##1914 The Royal Approval of Frankfurt university
ww1_germanrework.24.t: "The Founding of Frankfurt University"
ww1_germanrework.24.d: "The University of Frankfurt on Main was established on September 28th, 1912, when the foundation for forming the university was passed by Frankfurt's city government. It has it's roots in Goethe University, which was established in 1484, but was not officially considered to be one under German customs, as it did not issue degrees for almost half a millennia. Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."

ww1_germanrework.25.t: "Einstein Comes to Germany"
ww1_germanrework.25.d: "Albert Einstein, the renowned theoretical physicist, was recently offered a job as the director of the new Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, as well as membership in the Prussian Academy of Science and the Humboldt Academy of Berlin in order to be funded to conduct research. Max Planck - a theoretical physicist who served as president of the German Physical Institute from 1905 to 1909, and creator of Planck's Constant - and Walther Nernst - friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II and thermodynamic physicist - convinced Einstein to take these jobs. "
ww1_germanrework.25.a: "Great minds are always welcome!"

#Formation of the OHL
ww1_germanrework.40.t: "Formation of the OHL"
ww1_germanrework.40.d: "After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Prussian Army, Royal Saxon Army, Army of Württemberg and the Bavarian Army were autonomous in peacetime, each kingdom maintaining a separate war ministry and general staff to administer their forces. On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire ensures that the German Emperor would be made commander-in-chief of the combined armies.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Oberste Heeresleitung is now the highest echelon of command of the Heer of the German Empire, led by general Moltke. The OHL is split into sections that will take control over different parts of the country, whilst also monitoring politics and taking over the economy to ensure production remains most efficient for the army.\n\nIn addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consists of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers. "
ww1_germanrework.40.a: "To war, then."

#The Centre Block
ww1_germanrework.41.t: "The Centre Bloc"
ww1_germanrework.41.d: "The Centre of Germany has been the dominant force in the Empire's governing politics since its creation. The centrists are led by the trusted Zentrum party who formed in 1870, went on to successfully battle against the Kulturkampf waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. However, there are plenty of centrist parties in Germany who seek to make moderate social reform whilst ensuring that German traditional values are kept.\n\nIf Germany is going to continue to be stable throughout the next decade, the centrists must keep their power in Germany so that a moderate amount of rightist and leftist laws are passed into the bundesrat. Luckily, many of the key political figures in Germany, like Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, support the centrists and have aided them in keeping their majority in the Reichstag. "
ww1_germanrework.41.a: "Imperialism in moderation."

#The Growing Pan-German Influence
ww1_germanrework.42.t: "The Matter of the Pan-Germans"
ww1_germanrework.42.d: "Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein their goals were never truly achieved. After the unification, from the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, who since 1891 were organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, even calling for the annexation of Austria. The organization has greatly supported the educated middle and upper class; promoting German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, 'Deutsche Politik' (1905-07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe which many of the League have taken to heart.\n\nHowever, since the dawn of this new millennium, the Pan-Germans have taken a moderate stance to Austria, instead focusing on annexations in Russia and France. It seems for now the Pan-Germans have abandoned the annexationist policy around Austria."
ww1_germanrework.42.a: "Germany must sail a steady course."

#Adressing the matter of the German Identity
ww1_germanrework.43.t: "A 'German' Empire"
ww1_germanrework.43.d: "Since the Frankfurt Parliament's creation, the issue of 'German' land occupied by Poles has been a forefront issue of the nation's claims. Whilst we have begun Germanisation efforts in the areas of the empire occupied by Danes and Poles, there is still a silent cultural resistance against our rule in these areas. This issue of minorities on German land has led to conflicts on how the minorities should be treated by the government, currently Polish and Danish minorities can apply for German citizenship, but some centrists and leftists, including Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg want to expand the rights of minorities to ensure they can claim the same insurances and state benefits than any other German citizens can. On the other hand, the rightist factions in the Reichstag have instead proposed that minority citizenship have their 'perks' reduced to allow the government to use more fund towards the betterment of 'real' Germans."

Four naval bills have already been passed under Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Tirpitz is likely preparing to push for a fifth.\n\nThe Navy stands as a considerable force, yet if Germany truly intends to challenge British naval supremacy, significantly greater investment in naval production will be essential to match their formidable might."

Moltke is set to recover but will no longer be fit to serve in the army under any capacity. He has been immediately 'retired' by the Kaiser who has selected Falkenhayn as the new Chief. Wilhelm and the general staff hope that Falkenhayn's more realistic approach to the war will help Germany to make gains on the Eastern front and perhaps even commit to a breakthrough in France."

ww1_germanrework.47.d: "Contrary to Falkenhayn's expectations, the Entente was able to limit casualties in the divisions sent to the front. The procession of divisions back and forth was analogous to the operation of a 'noria', a type of water wheel that continuously lifts water and empties it into a trough which allowed the entente to scupper Falkenhayn's plan.\n\nOn top of this, both Hindenburg and Ludendorff have made clear they will resign from their positions unless Falkenhayn is removed and Hindenburg appointed head of the OHL using his failures to achieve their ambitions, the Kaiser if left with no choice but to accept."

Whilst Portugal has been our ally for some time, we did also promise to Germany we would support them in their colonial ambitions when we could... Leaving us in a predicament.

ww1_germanrework.55.t: "Germany Demands Angola"
ww1_germanrework.55.d: "Earlier this morning, the German embassy alongside the British have given our government an ultimatum to hand over the colony of Angola to the German Empire with haste, as a form of 'debt' repayment to Germany. Out situation is dire, and Britain's support of Germany doesn't bode well for our chances of resisting. Many in the administration have simply declared we are left with little choice to concede... although we can always petition the French to help curb these, Krauts."
ww1_germanrework.55.a: "We have no choice but to concede."
ww1_germanrework.55.b: "Call the French for help immediately!"
#Germany is informed Portugal Accepted
ww1_germanrework.56.t: "Portugal Cedes Angola"
ww1_germanrework.56.d: "Brillant news from abroad! Portugal has given into our demands to hand over Angola and our administration has begun to move into the colony. This victory has caused a positive uproar in Germany in support of the current government, with every newspaper worth a damn championing Bethmann Hollweg's 'victory of the decade', suffice to say, we can bask in the scorching sun of Angola freely."
ww1_germanrework.56.a: "A glorious diplomatic victory!"
#UK is informed Portugal Accepted
ww1_germanrework.57.t: "Portugal Ceded Angola"
ww1_germanrework.57.d: "Great news from Germany, they've confirmed that Portugal have handed over Angola to the German Colonial Administration. Our support of Germany has worked out for the best - we've avoided a larger crisis and appeased the Germany without distancing Portugal. However, we've already received angry complaints from the French foreign office on our support of Germany, it'll take some time to rebuild our trust with the French."
ww1_germanrework.57.a: "Another crisis averted."
#Germany and UK are informed Portugal rejected and sent France diplomats
ww1_germanrework.58.t: "Portugal Appeals to France"
ww1_germanrework.58.d: "Worrying news from Portugal, they've yet to officially respond to the demands for the German annexation of Angola and have made a plea to the French for diplomatic backing. Whilst France may still yet refuse, forcing Portugal to back down, should France support Portugal it will take delicate handling to defuse the situation."
ww1_germanrework.58.a: "Let us hope this does not escalate..."
#France gets asked by Portugal to help
ww1_germanrework.59.t: "Portuguese Diplomats Arrive in Paris"
ww1_germanrework.59.d: "We've received a worrying plea from Portugal today, earlier this week they've been sent an ultimatum from Britain and Germany calling for the German annexation of Angola. Now Portugal calls for us to back them, and even protect them should the aggressors attempt to take Angola forcefully from them. Most of government is worried about possibly starting a war with the UK and the Central Powers, but at the same time German aggression must be kept in check."
ww1_germanrework.59.a: "We must protect Portugal!"
ww1_germanrework.59.b: "This is not our concern."
#France accepts to help, Germany has a choice to back down or not
ww1_germanrework.60.t: "Portugal Gains French Support!"
ww1_germanrework.60.d: "France has come to the aid of Portugal and sent a clear message to us and the British that any action against Portugal is an action against France. Whilst backing down would be another diplomatic blunder, surely we can't risk war over Angola... even if the British continue to support us."
ww1_germanrework.60.a: "We will not back down!"
ww1_germanrework.60.b: "We have no choice but to withdraw our demand."
#France rejects to help, Portugal forced to back down
ww1_germanrework.61.t: "France Refuses to Help!"
ww1_germanrework.61.d: "Disaster. France has refused our plea for help, leaving us in a worse position than before. With pressure mounting on us to respond to the ultimatum, it seems we are forced to hand over Angola. We have been left to fend for ourselves against a hungry German dog."
ww1_germanrework.61.a: "We must concede."
#UK asked if they'll join Germany against France
ww1_germanrework.62.t: "Germany Asks for Help Against France"
ww1_germanrework.62.d: "Following France's defence of Portugal, it seems Germany is not planning to back down and instead has asked us to assure them of our unconditional support against France and Portugal. Whist we are obligated to support Germany, especially as we've already supported them diplomactically, now is our last chance to remove ourselves from what may turn out to be a far greater conflict.../n/nThe future of Europe may hang in the balance of our choice."
ww1_germanrework.62.a: "We must help our ally."
ww1_germanrework.62.b: "No. This has gone too far."
#UK told of Germany backing down
ww1_germanrework.63.t: "Germany Backs Down"
ww1_germanrework.63.d: "After the German government was made aware that the French had come to the support of Portugal, the Chancellor of the Riechstag told the Kaiser that he must instruct government to recind their demands. Wilhelm listened to his Chancellor's plea and since removed the demands.\n\nThank god that the Krauts backed down..."
ww1_germanrework.63.a: "Well, that is sorted."
#Portugal and France told of Germany backing down
ww1_germanrework.64.t: "Germany Backs Down"
ww1_germanrework.64.d: "Germany has rescinded their demands of Angola, meaning that Portugal and her colonies are now safe from the German dog! The support of the French government practically forced the Kaiser to order his government to back down, who would have thought that the fool could make his nation suffer even more shame?"
ww1_germanrework.64.a: "A great victory!"
#Germany told about Portugal backing down due to no French Support
ww1_germanrework.65.t: "Portugal Backs Down"
ww1_germanrework.65.d: "The French government having refused Portugal's plea for help has condemned Portugal to be forced to falter to our demands. The annexation of Angola will be immediate, and our colonial administration is already working to bring in the colony into the German Empire. Fortunately, there is already a strong German presence in Angola economically allowing us to quickly institute our new administration."
ww1_germanrework.65.a: "A glorious diplomatic victory!"
#UK told about Portugal backing down due to no French Support
ww1_germanrework.66.t: "Portugal Backs Down"
ww1_germanrework.66.d: "The French government, having refused Portugal's plea for help, has condemned Portugal to be forced to falter to our demands. Germany has already begun their annexation of Angola, and it's expected they will soon have set up their own administration there. Whilst the future of Portugal's colonies is uncertain, this victory for Germany highlights our new relationship with the Kaiser."
ww1_germanrework.66.a: "Crisis solved."
#News event about Germany and UK war with France
ww1_germanrework.67.t: "War Breaks Out In Europe!"
ww1_germanrework.67.d: "War in Europe! After Portugal refused a set of join demands from Britian and Germany, calling for the annexation of Angola, both nations have declared war on Portugal. However, France has come to the aid of Portugal in an attempt to curb German ambitions. No doubt other powers in Europe will soon enter the fray, including Russia and Austria.\n\nIn a centuries time, humanity will question why such a great conflict was started over just one colony..."

#Germany informed of British backstab
ww1_germanrework.68.t: "The United Kingdom Refuses to Help Us"
ww1_germanrework.68.d: "The British have turned and fled now that France has come to the support of Portugal. Whilst our government is enraged with the British, a course of action still needs to be decided, perhaps we can take them on our own... after all, we've done it once, we can do it again."
ww1_germanrework.68.a: "We cannot back down now!"

ww1_germanrework.69.t: "Germany Starts War with France!"
ww1_germanrework.69.d: "War in Europe! After Portugal refused a set of join demands from Britian and Germany, calling for the annexation of Angola, Germany has declared war on Portugal, notably without the support of Britain. However, France has come to the aid of Portugal in an attempt to curb German ambitions. No doubt other powers in Europe will soon enter the fray, including Russia and Austria.\n\nIn a centuries time, humanity will question why such a great conflict was started over just one colony..."
ww1_germanrework.69.a: "Can Germany win?"
#Germany backs down after UK backstab
ww1_germanrework.70.t: "Germany Backs Down to France"
ww1_germanrework.70.d: "After demanding the annexation of Angola from Portugal with the support of the United Kingdom, Germany has since rescinded the demands after its accomplice, Britain, withdrew its support following French involvement. This is another in a long series of foreign policy embarrassments for Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II."
ww1_germanrework.70.a: "An unexpected betrayal."

#Bethmann Hollweg Wartime Coalition
ww1_germanrework.49.t: "Wartime Coalition"
ww1_germanrework.49.d: "Now that Germany has been plunged into war, it's the responsibility of the Reichstag to ensure that the OHL can perform their duties to the empire without wading through the endless bureaucracy of the state. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has therefore unified the Reichstag, in its whole, into a coalition that will have the ability to pass laws without opposition. This coalition will allow the civilian government to remain in power, however the coalition is unstable at best, with parts of the SPD wing downright ignoring the coalition with their anti-war rhetoric, and the right's call for the SPD to be dismissed from the Reichstag does little to keep the coalition alive.\n\nIf we want to ensure the civilian government doesn't lose power to the OHL, we must ensure this coalition survives."
ww1_germanrework.49.a: "Peace in the Reichstag, war on the front."

#Paris Captured before the front stalls
ww1_germanrework.71.t: "Paris Captured"
ww1_germanrework.71.d: "Brilliant, if not glorious news from the front has been confirmed earlier today - the German army has captured Paris, the French may full well commit to surrender now, but either way this is a massive victory for the armed forces who are now sure to focus on achieving the collapse of the rest of the Entente. The OHL has suggested to the government that extreme measures be taken to ensure our army can decimate the russian rather than be cautious and risk dragging the war out."
ww1_germanrework.71.a: "Advance, Germania!"

#Army mass mobilisation - gone bad
ww1_germanrework.72.t: "The Front Stalls"
ww1_germanrework.72.d: "Concerning news from the front that has reached the Kaiser today, the German army has become increasingly inefficient since the failure to take Paris after our statements that the war would be a quick one. While the OHL is taking measures to ensure the army remains stable to continue attempting a breakthrough toward Paris it's clear that the military will suffer setbacks in the coming days. Only god can save us now."
ww1_germanrework.72.a: "This is not good."

ww1_germanrework.13.d: "Reports have arrived from German New Guinea detailing an armed uprising amongst the Sokehs people on the island of Pohnpei. Apparently sparked by disputes over land and forced labour demands from the colonial administration, the rebels have attacked German positions and defied local authorities. This blatant challenge to Imperial rule cannot be tolerated and requires immediate attention."

ww1_germanrework.14.d: "Our forces in German New Guinea report success in suppressing the Sokehs Rebellion.

#The Zabern Affair
#A Crisis Stirs
ww1_germanrework.26.t: "A Crisis Stirs in Zabern"
ww1_germanrework.26.d: "Earlier this week, the twenty-year-old Second Lieutenant Gunter Freiherr von Forstner of the Zabern garrison spoke disparagingly about that local inhabitants during a troop induction. The press reports that Forstner told his soldiers, 'If you are attacked, then make use of your weapon; if you stab such a Wackes in the process, then you'll get ten marks from me.' This event has been multiplied in severity by the media causing the local population to protest strongly against this treatment by the German military in the next few days."
ww1_germanrework.26.a: "It would be wise to keep an eye on this situation."
ww1_germanrework.27.t: "Further Troubles in Zabern"
ww1_germanrework.27.d: "After the events earlier this week, pressure from the Alsatian's and the SPD, the military saw fit to give Forstner 7 days house arrest, which was later repealed at his second hearing. Unfortunately, unimpressed by these actions, the Alsatian public continued to protest. As a further provocation, Lieutenant Forstner was reported to go out and aggravate the public after having his punishment repealed. Soon after a huge crowd of people again assembled before the barracks, which led to what the military court has called an 'inappropiate counter-reaction of the troops.'"
ww1_germanrework.27.a: "Let us hope this dies down..."
ww1_germanrework.27.b: "Listen to Bethmann Hollweg and punish Forstner."
ww1_germanrework.28.t: "The Zabern Affair"
ww1_germanrework.28.d: "The consequences of the incident at Zabern are seemingly growing far more rapidly, and to a greater extent, than the Kaiser had initially anticipated. Protests now are not only continuing in Zabern but have spread across the nation in support of the Alsatian's demand to seek justice. As if matters couldn't have gotten worse, not only has the press been alerted that Wilhelm was practically forced to leave his hunting vacation at Donauschingen to deal with the crisis by his own wife, but they are now also publishing papers that criticise the Kaiser for seemingly only heeding the viewpoint of the military - even excluding the chancellor from meetings.\n\nChancellor  Bethmann Hollweg has now been put into a tricky position by the Kaiser, it is his constitutional duty to support the Kaiser in all affairs and placate the Reichstag in his name. However, the Reichstag are beginning to call for a censure vote where they will show their disproval to the Kaiser by recommending that he replaces his chancellor - as is their right. Therefore, to retain his position, and for the betterment of the Reich, Bethmann Hollweg could instead align himself with the Reichstag and join the demands for justice."
ww1_germanrework.28.a: "The Chancellor is loyal to his duties."
ww1_germanrework.28.b: "Bethmann Hollweg aligns with the Reichstag."
ww1_germanrework.29.t: "The Censure Vote"
ww1_germanrework.29.d: "As predicted, the Reichstag had called for a censure vote in chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's leadership and as is his right, earlier this week he delivered first speech to defend his actions. Bethmann Hollweg, determined to keep the status quo steady, stood behind the Kaiser's and the militray's actions, doing little to endear himself to the Reichstag and audible displays of defiance could be heard from the left throughout his speech. This morning he delivered his second and final speech to try and appeal to the centre and parties in a hope that their votes will be enough to turn the tide."
ww1_germanrework.29.a: "The die is cast."
ww1_germanrework.30.t: "The Votes Are In"
ww1_germanrework.30.d: "After a rather rushed session in the Reichstag, the votes have been counted and the results made public - a defeat for Bethmann Hollweg. It has now been offically declared that the current government is 'not of the view of the Reichstag.' Whilst this does not mean Bethmann Hollweg is being forced to step down, especically as the Kaiser shows no willingness to remove Bethmann Hollweg, if Bethmann Hollweg does choose to continue on it will highlight the facade of German 'democracy' and will surley tarnish the chancellor's reputation."
ww1_germanrework.30.a: "Bethmann Hollweg will march on."
ww1_germanrework.30.b: "The Chancellor resigns."
ww1_germanrework.31.t: "The Old Order Holds"
ww1_germanrework.31.d: "The events of the past few weeks have finnaly been concluded, to little effect in the echelons of power, even if the left-wing are less than appealed. The Chancellor will now continue his work, even if partially now opposed by the SPD - alas, at least the military is appeased. The Zabern Affiar will be remembered as a key event in the history our ownership over Elssas-Lothringen, and one can only hope that soon the Alsatian people will accept their true German identity with haste."
ww1_germanrework.31.a: "An uneasy stability returns."
ww1_germanrework.32.t: "A Swift Resolution"
ww1_germanrework.32.d: "The Kaiser, having opted to impose a swift punishment on Forstner, has seemingly averted a political and constitutional crisis. Once the Kaiser had been made aware of the situation, he left his hunting event and immediately called for the punishment Forstner. The Reichstag and locals are placated but, as expected, the military feel scored and dishonoured by the Kaiser after his direct intervention into military affairs."
ww1_germanrework.32.a: "You cannot please everyone."
ww1_germanrework.33.t: "Constitutional Crisis"
ww1_germanrework.33.d: "The Chancellor of the center seemed to have moved to the left, he and the Reichstag are unied against the millitary influence over civil politics. Apepasing this opposition would anger the millitary and empower the ministry, perhaps we could restore order by other means."
ww1_germanrework.33.a: "Empower Bethmann Hollweg. The millitary must know its place."
ww1_germanrework.33.b: "Sack Bethmann Hollweg. The army's authority is supreme."
ww1_germanrework.34.t: "The Zabern Affair"
ww1_germanrework.34.d: "The Zabern Affair, occured in the German Empire, a significant political and social controversy exposed the tensions between military authority and civil society. The incident began in the town of Zabern when a confrontation between a local soldier and civilians escalated, leading to excessive military force and arrests. The local military commanders dismissed civilian concerns, further inflaming public outrage and protests. The affair quickly became a national issue, with political factions in the Reichstag criticizing the military's actions, particularly the Social Democrats who called for accountability and reform."
ww1_germanrework.34.a: "The Kaiser's uniform must be respected under all circumstances!"
ww1_germanrework.34.b: "The military is not above the rule of law!"

#Krupp-Vickers Collab
ww1_germanrework.73.t: "Krupp and Vickers Announce Joint Industrial Venture"
ww1_germanrework.73.d: "In a remarkable development, representatives of Friedrich Krupp AG and Vickers Ltd. have signed a formal agreement establishing a joint industrial consortium. The venture, hailed as unprecedented, will facilitate technological cooperation, resource sharing, and coordinated research in metallurgy, heavy machinery, and naval engineering.\n\nWhile ostensibly commercial, the implications are deeply political. For decades, Krupp and Vickers symbolized the naval arms race between Germany and Britain. That the two firms now work side by side is seen by many as a sign of strategic détente.\n\nThe German Foreign Office has welcomed the news, citing it as proof that mutual interest and rational cooperation can triumph over rivalry. In London, reactions are more measured, but cautiously optimistic."
ww1_germanrework.73.a: "Economic logic overcomes old enmities."


ww1_germanrework.74.t: "Status of Elsaß and Lothringen"
ww1_germanrework.74.d: "Elsaß-Lothringen is a Reichsland, which is an imperial land under the direct authority of the German Empire since its annexation in 1871. Governed by a Statthalter appointed by the Emperor, the region lacks the autonomy enjoyed by other federal states. Its population, largely composed of Alsatian and French speakers, has long expressed discontent with central control and the ongoing Germanization policies affecting education and public life.\n\nWith the promulgation of a new constitution, and the establishement of a regional parliament, some limited legislative powers on local matters will be provided. The territory will also gains representation in both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, enhancing its participation in imperial affairs. While key authority remains in Berlin, this reform might marks a significant step toward integration within the federal structure and is widely seen as a move to address longstanding regional grievances."
ww1_germanrework.74.a: "We will solve this issue soon enough."

ww1_germanrework.75.t: "Modernization of the Schlieffen Plan?"
ww1_germanrework.75.d: "The General Staff is pressing for a rewrite of the Schlieffen Plan, designed to invade France via the Benelux. The Generalstab has proposed a more aggressive version of the plan, aiming to leave the Netherlands behind and instead focus on a forward offensive directly against Belgium.\n\nWar Minister Josias von Heeringen has already made it clear that, in his view, such a plan is too risky and would exhaust soldiers and immobilize the front. Many other generals disagree, and a decision must be made on whether or not to approve this new plan."
ww1_germanrework.75.a: "The new plan is a sound compromise."
ww1_germanrework.75.b: "Stick to the original plan."

ww1_germanrework.76.t: "Failure on Western Front"
ww1_germanrework.76.d: "Despite intense mobilization by our army, we have not managed to take control of Verdun-sur-Meuse. In addition to being a strategic artery, the region is fortified, which would have opened the door to a broader offensive from which we will not be able to take advantage."

ww1_germanrework.78.t: "Ypres Still Stands"

ww1_germanrework.79.t: "First Armored Brigade Formed"
ww1_germanrework.79.d: "The first batches of Joseph Vollmer's heavy tank are ready, forming enough units for support use or large battalions. Due to the high cost of the tank, the A7V has not yet been mass-produced, its usefulness remaining to be proven in the field."

ww1_germanrework.108.t: "A Proposal for American Mediation"
ww1_germanrework.108.d: "With the war dragging on longer than expected and casualties mounting on both fronts, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has proposed an unorthodox initiative: appealing to the United States to mediate a peace conference between the warring powers. The hope is that President [USA.getLeader], who has remained officially neutral thus far, might be willing to bring both sides to the table.\n\nThe proposal is bold and risky. Some in the Reichstag fear it may be seen as a sign of weakness. Yet others argue that without a diplomatic breakthrough, the war could spiral into a prolonged and unwinnable struggle.\n\nBethmann Bethmann Hollweg might send a confidential communication to Washington, requesting American involvement as a neutral facilitator."
ww1_germanrework.108.a: "We must try. Send the message to Washington."
ww1_germanrework.108.b: "Too dangerous. We will not appear desperate."

ww1_germanrework.109.t: "Germany Proposes Peace Mediation"
ww1_germanrework.109.d: "A diplomatic cable has arrived from Berlin. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg, citing the deepening bloodshed in Europe, has formally requested that the United States mediate a general peace conference between the warring powers. The German government seeks what it calls 'a peace with honour' and hopes America's neutrality and moral authority will convince the Entente to come to the table.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] and his advisors are divided. Some welcome the opportunity to restore peace and affirm America's role as a global arbiter. Others are wary of German motives, suspecting this could be a ploy to solidify gains or drive a wedge between Entente powers.\n\nWhile the offer is unprecedented, the choice now lies with us: engage diplomatically, or remain at arm's length."
ww1_germanrework.109.a: "We will explore the possibility of peace."
ww1_germanrework.109.b: "This is not the right moment. Decline the request."

ww1_germanrework.110.t: "American Refusal to Mediate"
ww1_germanrework.110.d: "The response from Washington has arrived. President [USA.getLeader] has declined our request to mediate a peace conference. While carefully worded and diplomatically phrased, the message leaves no room for doubt: the United States will not intervene at this time.\n\nThe Chancellor had placed considerable hope in a neutral American initiative to bring the Entente to the negotiating table. With this door now closed, critics within the Reichstag speak of a missed opportunity and renewed calls are heard from the General Staff to prepare for a long and total war.\n\nThe situation on both fronts remains unchanged, and prospects for a diplomatic resolution grow dimmer with each passing day."
ww1_germanrework.110.a: "Then we must prepare to win the war by force."

ww1_germanrework.111.t: "America Considers Our Proposal"
ww1_germanrework.111.d: "A response from Washington has arrived. President [USA.getLeader], while cautious and clearly uncertain of our true intentions, has agreed in principle to explore the possibility of a peace conference. He has informed us that the United States is willing to act as a neutral intermediary — if the Entente is open to the idea.\n\nThough no concrete commitments have been made, this is the most promising diplomatic opening we have had since the war began. The Chancellor remains optimistic, but aware that any misstep or miscommunication may derail the process before it begins.\n\nAll now depends on how the Entente responds to the prospect of mediated negotiations."

Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg proposes to initiate peace talks under American mediation, offering what he describes as 'a peace with honour.'\n\nThe proposal does not include any preconditions, but its timing suggests concern within the German leadership over the war's duration and mounting losses. President [USA.getLeader] appears open to acting as facilitator, though he emphasizes that this is only a first step. Within our own ranks, opinions are divided. Some argue this may be an opportunity to secure favourable terms before further bloodshed. Others view it as a transparent ploy by Germany to consolidate its gains and weaken Allied unity.\n\nWe must now decide whether to acknowledge the offer — or reject it outright."
ww1_germanrework.112.a: "We will listen, cautiously."

ww1_germanrework.113.a: "We will observe with interest."

ww1_germanrework.114.t: "The Belgian Question"
ww1_germanrework.114.d: "As diplomatic efforts cautiously advance, a central question now dominates internal discussion in Washington: what stance should we adopt regarding Belgium?\n\nThe British and French insist that any acceptable peace must guarantee the full restoration of Belgian sovereignty. Public opinion in the United States, too, remains sympathetic to Belgium's plight since the 1914 invasion. But early signals from Berlin suggest that the Germans are unlikely to agree to an unconditional withdrawal.\n\nSome advisors argue we must make Belgian liberation the cornerstone of any American mediation effort — failure to do so could cost us moral authority. Others caution that issuing ultimatums too early may cause the Germans to walk away before negotiations truly begin."
ww1_germanrework.114.a: "Demand full and immediate restoration of Belgian sovereignty."

ww1_germanrework.115.t: "The German Offer: Belgium for the Congo"
ww1_germanrework.115.d: "Under continued American mediation, the German government has now made its most significant concession to date: a full and unconditional withdrawal from occupied Belgian territory. In return, Germany requests the cession of Congo — currently administered by Belgium — as colonial compensation. Washington views the proposal as a balanced compromise that could end the war while satisfying core Allied demands.\n\nThe offer has stunned the Quai d'Orsay and divided the Cabinet. Some argue that Belgium's full liberation fulfills our war aims, and the Congo is ultimately a peripheral matter. Others reject the idea of rewarding aggression with imperial gain, warning that acquiescing would set a dangerous precedent — and strain Franco-Belgian relations.\n\nThe decision now rests here, in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
ww1_germanrework.115.b: "Accept. Belgium is free, and peace is within reach."
ww1_germanrework.115.a: "Reject. We will not reward German conquest."

ww1_germanrework.116.t: "The Entente Rejects Our Offer"
ww1_germanrework.116.d: "The American delegation has returned with sobering news: the Entente powers have formally rejected our proposal for a general peace settlement. Despite our commitment to a complete withdrawal from Belgium — a concession that many in Berlin deemed excessive — the Allied governments have refused to cede the Congo as compensation, denouncing the offer as an attempt to exchange imperial conquest for European withdrawal.\n\nThe Chancellor is bitterly disappointed. Within the Reichstag, opposition grows louder, and among the General Staff, voices now call for the immediate resumption of full-scale operations. The dream of a mediated peace has collapsed, and with it, any remaining illusion that the war might be ended through reason."

ww1_germanrework.117.t: "Germany Threatens Unrestricted Submarine Warfare"
ww1_germanrework.117.d: "A stark message has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] from Washington: the German delegation has informed President Wilson that, should the Entente continue to reject their peace overtures, Berlin will have no choice but to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The implications are grave. Such a move would target neutral shipping, including American vessels, and likely provoke U.S. entry into the war — a development the Germans appear willing to risk. The Chancellor's ultimatum is clear: accept the proposed terms, or prepare for a new phase of total war at sea.\n\nIn the Cabinet, opinions are sharply divided. Some argue that this is a desperate bluff, others see it as a calculated escalation that could shift the global balance. The future of the war may hang in the balance."
ww1_germanrework.117.a: "Let them threaten. We will not yield to blackmail."

ww1_germanrework.118.d: "Despite all the pressure our delegation has been able to exert, as well as the threat of total and unrestricted submarine warfare, the representatives of the Entente have not changed their positions and refuse to give in to our conditions, even though they are legitimate. This situation is forcing us to prolong the war, which may not work in our favor."

ww1_germanrework.119.t: "Failure of the Peace Conference"
ww1_germanrework.119.d: "Despite our best efforts to mediate a negotiated settlement, the peace initiative has collapsed. The Entente powers refused to accept the proposed terms, which included a complete German withdrawal from Belgium in exchange for colonial compensation in the Congo. France and Britain denounced the offer as morally unacceptable, and no further concessions could be obtained from Berlin. The German government, for its part, failed to exert sufficient pressure to move the talks forward, despite threatening to resume unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nWhat began as a bold diplomatic gamble has ended in deadlock. With mutual suspicion deeper than ever, and no compromise in sight, the guns will speak once more. For now, the war continues."

ww1_germanrework.120.t: "The Peace Talks Collapse"
ww1_germanrework.120.d: "The American-led peace initiative has come to nothing. After weeks of confidential discussions, President [USA.getLeader] has informed our governments that Berlin will not withdraw from Belgium without receiving colonial compensation — a proposal we unanimously rejected. Germany offered to vacate Belgium only if granted the Congo, a demand we deemed outrageous and incompatible with the principles for which we fight. No further compromise has emerged, and Berlin has not delivered sufficient pressure — military or diplomatic — to force the issue.\n\nThe conference is over. While some in our governments express relief that we avoided a dishonourable settlement, others grow anxious. The war continues, with no end in sight. Our people grow weary, and the costs climb higher each day."

ww1_germanrework.121.d: "After weeks of cautious diplomacy and mounting pressure, word has come from Washington: the Entente powers have formally agreed to the American framework for peace. Under this arrangement, we will withdraw from all occupied Belgian territory in exchange for the Congo, transferred from Belgian administration to German colonial control. While many in the General Staff bristle at the loss of a hard-fought strategic position, the Chancellor sees this as a crucial first step toward a negotiated end to the war.\n\nYet the road ahead remains long and uncertain. The questions of Alsace-Lorraine, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and naval disarmament all loom large. For now, however, we have achieved a diplomatic breakthrough, and possibly saved Germany from a war of total exhaustion."

ww1_germanrework.122.d: "With a tentative agreement reached over Belgium and the Congo, attention now turns to the most symbolically charged issue of the war: the fate of [28.getName]-[1107.getName].\n\nFrance demands the full return of the two provinces, citing historic claims and national honor. Germany, meanwhile, insists on retaining the territory as an integral part of the Reich since 1871, warning that any concession would be politically explosive.\n\nSeveral compromise options have emerged. Some American advisors suggest a division of the provinces along cultural or linguistic lines. Others propose a neutral solution, the creation of an independent [28.getName]-[1107.getName], guaranteed by international powers. The decision will shape the next phase of the peace process — and may determine whether talks survive or collapse."

Under the mediation of President [USA.getLeader], representatives of the Central Powers and the Entente have been meeting behind closed doors to explore the conditions for ending the bloodshed.\n\nWhile no definitive settlement has been signed, sources close to the talks report a series of breakthroughs. Germany has agreed to withdraw from Belgium in exchange for colonial compensation, and the long-standing dispute over Alsace-Lorraine has now entered formal deliberations. Though fragile, the diplomatic momentum is undeniable. Some hope that the United States may yet succeed in brokering a general peace."

After consultations with Paris, President [USA.getLeader] has formally requested that Germany return the provinces of [28.getName] and [1107.getName] to France as part of a general peace settlement.\n\nThe reaction in Berlin is explosive. The Reichstag is divided between those who view this as an intolerable humiliation and those who see no path to peace without difficult concessions. The General Staff warns that abandoning the provinces would provoke unrest at home and embolden enemy demands elsewhere.\n\nChancellor Bethmann Hollweg faces a moment of truth. Refusing may shatter the fragile framework for peace. Accepting may cost the government its legitimacy.\n\nThe fate of the Reich — and the war — may turn on this decision."

ww1_germanrework.125.d: "The German government has officially communicated its willingness to cede [28.getName]-[1107.getName] to France, under the terms proposed by the American delegation.\n\nThis development marks a historic turning point. The provinces, long a source of deep animosity between France and Germany, have been at the heart of European tension for nearly half a century. That Berlin is now prepared to relinquish them is a testament to both the pressure of war and the promise of peace.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] and his advisors view this decision as a major diplomatic breakthrough. For the first time, it appears that both sides may be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a close. Much remains to be negotiated, but the path forward is clearer than ever."
ww1_germanrework.125.a: "We are nearing the end of this long nightmare."

ww1_germanrework.126.t: "Germany Accepts to Return Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.126.d: "It is now official. Under American mediation, the German government has agreed to the full restitution of Alsace and Lorraine to France. The provinces, taken by force in 1871, are to return to the Republic — not through arms alone, but through relentless diplomatic and military pressure.\n\nThe announcement has sent a wave of emotion through the Chamber of Deputies and the streets of Paris. Yet it is not the end. The conditions of peace remain incomplete: the questions of the Balkans, of reparations, of disarmament — all still lie ahead.\n\nBut today, we are a step closer to justice. A step closer to victory."

ww1_germanrework.127.t: "America Urges Us to Relinquish Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.127.d: "An official note has arrived from President [USA.getLeader]'s delegation. In the interest of preserving the fragile peace process, the United States urges France to drop its claim to Alsace-Lorraine. The Americans argue that demanding the return of the provinces could derail negotiations entirely, provoke German unrest, and prolong the war. They propose alternative forms of compensation — economic, colonial, or symbolic, but make it clear that the issue is, in their view, secondary to the wider goal of peace.\n\nThe Cabinet is stunned. For millions of French citizens, Alsace and Lorraine are not a bargaining chip: they are France. To yield now would mean betraying the very cause for which our soldiers have fought and died. We must respond, with dignity and resolve."

ww1_germanrework.128.d: "In a move that few believed possible, the French government has officially agreed to drop its claim on Alsace-Lorraine, clearing a major obstacle in the peace process. Though the decision was met with heavy resistance in the Chamber of Deputies and the French press, President [USA.getLeader]'s insistence on compromise, and the promise of an early end to the war, ultimately persuaded Paris to make this difficult concession.\n\nThe German delegation has responded cautiously, still wary of potential conditions or future reversals. Nevertheless, Washington now sees a real opportunity to steer the negotiations toward a general armistice.\n\nThe world watches with bated breath. A conflict born out of iron and blood may yet be ended by diplomacy and restraint."

ww1_germanrework.129.t: "America Proposes Partition of Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.129.d: "A new diplomatic note from Washington has arrived. Seeking a path between the French demand for full restitution and the German refusal to concede anything, the American delegation now proposes a territorial compromise: a partition of Alsace-Lorraine. Under this proposal, Lorraine would return to France, while Alsace — or at least a portion of it — would remain under German control. President [USA.getLeader] describes it as a 'measured and rational' solution, aimed at preserving peace and satisfying both sides.\n\nThe reaction in Paris is visceral. Many view the offer as an affront to national honor and a betrayal of our sacrifices. Others, worn down by years of war, argue that even a partial return would be preferable to continued bloodshed."
ww1_germanrework.129.a: "Unacceptable. The provinces must return whole."
ww1_germanrework.129.b: "We will consider the proposal, under protest."

ww1_germanrework.130.t: "France Rejects Partition of Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.130.d: "The French government has formally rejected our proposed compromise on the Alsace-Lorraine question. Despite our efforts to de-escalate tensions by suggesting a partition — with Lorraine returning to France and Alsace remaining under German control — Paris has issued a firm and categorical refusal.\n\nFrench officials describe the offer as 'unacceptable, both morally and historically.' The Chamber of Deputies reportedly reacted with indignation, and elements within the French press have begun questioning American neutrality. President [USA.getLeader] is now faced with a difficult choice: press on with mediation, risking a collapse of negotiations, or shift focus toward securing peace on other fronts.\n\nThe failure to resolve the Alsace-Lorraine dispute casts a long shadow over the talks."
ww1_germanrework.130.a: "Disappointing — but not the end. We will seek another path."

ww1_germanrework.131.d: "After intense debate within the French government, President [USA.getLeader] has received confirmation from Paris: France will accept the proposed partition of Alsace-Lorraine, though reluctantly and under protest. Under this arrangement, Lorraine will return to France, while Alsace — or at least a portion of it — will remain under German administration. French leaders insist this is a compromise born not of satisfaction, but of exhaustion and duty to peace.\n\nThe decision has sparked protests in parts of France, and political backlash is expected. Yet diplomats in Washington view the outcome as a major step toward a comprehensive settlement. President [USA.getLeader] acknowledges the gravity of this moment — and the sacrifice it represents. The path to peace remains narrow, but it is still open."

The American delegation informs us that France, though clearly dissatisfied, has accepted the proposed compromise on [28.getName]-[1107.getName]: [1107.getName] will be ceded to France, while [28.getName] may remain within the Reich.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] now urges Germany to approve this arrangement in order to move the broader peace talks forward. Within the Reichstag and the General Staff, reactions are mixed. Some view this as a strategic victory — preserving part of the disputed territory while avoiding total concession. Others see any territorial loss as a dangerous precedent and a humiliation. The decision is now ours. Accept a compromise that ends the war on favorable terms — or refuse, and risk losing everything."
ww1_germanrework.132.a: "Agree to the partition — it preserves our interests."

ww1_germanrework.133.d: "Berlin has spoken. Despite France's reluctant acceptance of our proposed partition of Alsace-Lorraine, the German government has refused the offer outright. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's response, though couched in diplomatic language, leaves no room for ambiguity. Germany will not agree to any territorial loss in the disputed provinces, not even a partial concession. Internal reports suggest the Kaiser and General Staff view even symbolic compromise as unacceptable.\n\nThe rejection has shaken confidence in the peace process. President [USA.getLeader], who had worked tirelessly to bring both sides toward reconciliation, now faces mounting pressure at home and abroad. The Entente is furious. Paris, having sacrificed politically to accept the deal, now questions whether Germany is acting in good faith. Unless Berlin reconsiders, this could mark the end of the talks."

Despite fierce opposition from elements within the General Staff and the Reichstag, Berlin has accepted the compromise: Lorraine will return to France, while Alsace remains under German control. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has framed the decision as a 'painful but necessary step' toward peace.\n\nWith both France and Germany now in agreement, President [USA.getLeader] believes that an armistice on the Western Front is finally within reach. The American delegation is already preparing a formal framework for cessation of hostilities and transition toward a broader peace treaty.\n\nIt is a fragile but historic moment.

According to Washington, the long-disputed question of Alsace-Lorraine, which for years has stood as one of the principal obstacles to any resolution, has now been 'successfully arranged' between the concerned parties. Though details remain confidential, U.S. officials have described the outcome as 'mutually tolerable' and 'historically significant'.\n\nAs a result, talks are now moving toward the drafting of a formal ceasefire agreement on the Western Front. Should progress continue at this pace, an armistice may be declared in the coming days or weeks. Across the capitals of the Entente, a cautious sense of hope begins to replace the long-worn fatigue of war."

While the specific terms remain undisclosed, the breakthrough has created new momentum in the negotiations.\n\nWith this turning point, the prospect of a formal ceasefire on the Western Front is now being actively discussed. Further sessions are scheduled to finalize the framework of an armistice.\n\nWhile nothing is yet certain, hopes rise across the Central Powers that the end of this long and bitter war may finally be within reach."

The proposal envisions a demilitarized buffer state, with its own government and symbolic neutrality.\n\nIn Berlin, reactions are divided. Some see this as a clever compromise that avoids ceding territory to France. Others regard it as a thinly veiled loss — an abandonment of sovereign land won through war and held for nearly half a century. The Reich must now decide whether to consider this path — or risk the collapse of the peace talks."

Under this arrangement, the provinces will be transformed into a neutral and self-governing state, with its sovereignty guaranteed by the major powers. The region will be demilitarized and removed from direct French or German control — a symbolic gesture toward reconciliation.\n\nThe decision in Berlin was hard-fought. Internal resistance from military and nationalist factions was fierce, but Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg ultimately prevailed by presenting the proposal as a path to both peace and dignity. American diplomats now believe this may be the breakthrough that unlocks a general armistice on the Western Front. For the first time, the shadow of compromise eclipses the specter of total war."

While the plan was designed to satisfy both French and German concerns, Berlin has dismissed it as an unacceptable fragmentation of sovereign territory. Sources close to the Chancellor report intense pressure from the military and conservative factions, who consider any loss — symbolic or real — of Alsace-Lorraine to be intolerable.\n\nThe rejection casts a long shadow over the peace negotiations. President [USA.getLeader] had hoped the independence model would break the deadlock between France and Germany. With that option now off the table, the future of the talks is uncertain, and the possibility of renewed hostilities looms once more.\n\nThere is still time to act — but the window is closing."

Some see this as a diplomatic victory — proof that Germany blinked. Others view it as a betrayal of national honor, the final sacrifice of a land reclaimed by blood in 1871 and again hoped for in this war.\n\nPublic opinion is volatile.

ww1_germanrework.141.d: "Amid growing pressure from the Reichstag majority and rising social unrest, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has presented a proposal to reform the deeply unequal electoral system of the Kingdom of Prussia. The plan would abolish the three-class voting system — which grants disproportionate power to the wealthy elite — and replace it with a more democratic and egalitarian structure, closer to the universal male suffrage used in Reichstag elections.\n\nThe proposal was designed to preserve national unity, strengthen the Chancellor's peace efforts abroad, and offer a gesture toward the Social Democrats and moderate liberals. But it has met overwhelming resistance.\n\nConservative elites, the military command, and even members of the imperial family have denounced the plan as a threat to the established order. The General Staff has privately warned the Kaiser that such reforms during wartime would 'undermine national discipline'. The proposal has not even reached the floor of the Prussian Landtag. It is dead before arrival."

His reform initiatives, including a proposed democratization of the Prussian electoral system, collapsed under fierce opposition from the military, conservative elites, and the imperial court. His attempts at peace mediation through Washington were equally unsuccessful, and his authority has steadily eroded.\n\nThe Supreme Army Command, led by Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, made it clear that they would no longer cooperate with Bethmann Hollweg. Facing a government crisis and fearing instability, the Kaiser accepted his resignation. Georg Michaelis, a little-known bureaucrat and loyal servant of the monarchy, has been appointed as the new Chancellor. Though lacking political experience, he is expected to follow the direction of the military leadership closely."

Our analysts report that the enemy's naval superiority, while still present, is no longer as overwhelming as it once was.\n\nThis welcome development means more of our merchant ships and neutral traders might slip through the net, bringing vital supplies.

ww1_germanrework.145.d: "A diplomatic cable from the German Foreign Office has arrived in Whitehall, bearing an unprecedented proposal: the Kaiserreich formally proposes a treaty of friendship between the German Empire and the British Crown.\n\nIn the document, Berlin emphasizes the success of recent Anglo-German understandings — the Haldane negotiations, the naval détente, and growing commercial cooperation between firms like Krupp and Vickers. Furthermore, the note references the recent joint resolution over the future of Angola, suggesting a foundation of trust has been laid.\n\nYet the implications of such a pact are immense. While it would neutralize tensions in the North Sea and potentially spare the Empire from a continental entanglement, it would also risk severing our long-standing friendship with France. Such a shift in alignment would be viewed as a betrayal in Paris, possibly fracturing the Entente entirely. The Foreign Office must now weigh the benefits of detente with Berlin against the cost of alienating our allies on the continent."

The note highlights the fruits of recent cooperation — the success of the Haldane mission, the naval détente, and joint economic initiatives — as proof that the two great powers need not be rivals. British officials frame the accord not as an alliance, but as a commitment to neutrality and mutual respect.\n\nIn Berlin, the response is celebrated as a diplomatic coup. For the first time in decades, the possibility of a stable Anglo-German relationship seems within reach. Still, not all is calm. Paris remains silent — for now. But none doubt that this decision may shatter the very foundation of the Entente Cordiale."

ww1_germanrework.147.d: "A formal response has arrived from the Foreign Office in London. The tone is polite, but the message is unmistakably clear: the British government has declined our proposal for a treaty of friendship. Citing historic obligations to France and concerns about the balance of power in Europe, Britain has reaffirmed its commitment to the Entente. While acknowledging recent diplomatic progress — the naval agreements, economic cooperation, and the Angola understanding — Whitehall insists that these do not warrant a shift in alignment.\n\nIn Berlin, the news is met with frustration and quiet resolve. Many had hoped that a new understanding might prevent a future collision. That hope has now dimmed. Whatever peace we had built, it seems, was never meant to endure without Paris’s approval.

The agreement, concluded after months of confidential talks and following the successful Haldane Mission, puts an end to decades of naval and imperial rivalry. \n\nObservers note the deepening ties between German and British industries, with the Vickers-Krupp partnership seen as emblematic of this new chapter. The treaty has sent shockwaves through Europe, notably the Entente. French newspapers warn of a betrayal, while Berlin hails the accord as a step toward lasting continental stability. British officials have been quick to clarify that the treaty does not constitute a military alliance, but it nonetheless marks a clear realignment of diplomatic priorities."
ww1_germanrework.148.a: "A historic realignment has begun."
ww1_germanrework.148.b: "Nique sa mère"
ww1_germanrework.148.c: "This is unexpected."

ww1_germanrework.149.t: "Unauthorized Naval Offensive Ordered"
ww1_germanrework.149.d: "The Reich government has been informed that the High Seas Fleet has issued orders for a full-scale naval operation against British positions in the English Channel, without prior approval from Berlin.\n\nThe plan, drafted in secret by the naval command, calls for the entire fleet to sortie in what appears to be a last act of defiance, intended to redeem the honor of the navy before any armistice takes effect. The civilian leadership is outraged. Not only was the decision taken unilaterally, but it also risks triggering widespread mutiny: there is little doubt that the exhausted and war-weary sailors will refuse to carry out such a suicidal mission."
ww1_germanrework.149.a: "This is madness!"

ww1_germanrework.150.t: "Urgent Reforms to Secure Peace"
ww1_germanrework.150.d: "With the war turning decisively against us and the American president making democratic reform a precondition for peace talks, the Imperial government has initiated sweeping constitutional changes.\n\nA series of emergency decrees and parliamentary revisions have been passed: the Chancellor will now be fully responsible to the Reichstag, and military decisions will fall under civilian oversight. These moves are designed to convince the United States that Germany is no longer an autocracy — and thus eligible for negotiations under their terms.\n\nTime is of the essence, and each delay risks more bloodshed."
ww1_germanrework.150.a: "If democracy brings peace, so be it."

ww1_germanrework.151.t: "Chancellor Michaelis Resigns"
ww1_germanrework.151.d: "Georg Michaelis, appointed as Chancellor after the fall of Bethmann Hollweg, has proven unable to consolidate authority. Lacking both the confidence of the military leadership and the support of the Reichstag’s major parties, Michaelis has been criticized for his indecision and aloofness.\n\nAmid mounting frustration and internal discord, he has submitted his resignation. In his place, Georg von Hertling — a more seasoned politician with ties to the Centre Party — has been asked to form a new government. Hertling is expected to maintain cautious cooperation with the parliamentary majority."
ww1_germanrework.151.a: "A weak chancellor falls, another takes his place."

ww1_germanrework.152.t: "Chancellor Hertling Resigns"
ww1_germanrework.152.d: "With the Reich facing political unrest and growing calls for reform, Chancellor Georg von Hertling has tendered his resignation. A staunch conservative, he lacked the flexibility and legitimacy to manage the new realities of governance. In his place, the Kaiser has appointed Prince Max von Baden—a liberal-leaning aristocrat seen as acceptable to both monarchists and reformists. His mandate: preserve the monarchy through change, not resistance."

ww1_germanrework.153.t: "Ludendorff Resigns"
ww1_germanrework.153.d: "Under mounting political pressure and amid rising civilian control over military affairs, General Erich Ludendorff has submitted his resignation. Once the architect of total war and de facto leader of the Empire, his authority had become a liability in a changing Germany. His departure marks the end of military dominance over politics—and the beginning of a fragile civilian ascendancy."
ww1_germanrework.153.a: "The old order retreats."

ww1_germanrework.154.t: "The OHL Grows Restless"
ww1_germanrework.154.d: "With Austria-Hungary collapsing under internal revolt and military defeat, the burden of victory now falls squarely on German shoulders. The OHL, already frustrated with civilian hesitation and political compromise, views the situation as dire. Hindenburg and Ludendorff push for a bold, unilateral offensive—arguing that only a decisive blow can restore strategic balance. Civilian leaders are left sidelined, as the military asserts de facto control."
ww1_germanrework.154.a: "The sword guides the Reich once more."

ww1_germanrework.155.t: "Berlin Munitions Strike"
ww1_germanrework.155.d: "Rationing, inflation, and declining wages had created explosive tension in Berlin's industrial districts. When the government announced further reductions in bread and meat rations, workers from key munitions plants initiated a mass walkout. Organized in part by left-leaning shop stewards and radical SPD elements, the protest was not just about hunger—it was a warning against militarized rule and the human cost of endless war.\n\nFortunately, the strike didnt last long and workers came back to work. But the government is afraid the situation worsen with stricter rationing."
ww1_germanrework.155.a: "The people are growing desperate."

ww1_germanrework.156.t: "Bremen School Shooting"
ww1_germanrework.156.d: "A devastating school shooting occurred at St. Mary's Catholic School in Bremen, leaving five young girls dead and over twenty others injured. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old unemployed teacher Heinz Schmidt, unleashed a barrage of gunfire inside the school before being subdued by staff members.\n\nOver 30,000 mourners attended the funeral of the victims, including Kaiser Wilhelm, who personally altered his schedule to be present and subsequently pushed for stricter gun control laws in the aftermath of the shooting."
ww1_germanrework.156.a: "Guns have no place in our classrooms!"

ww1_germanrework.157.t: "Helgoland Island Air Disaster"
ww1_germanrework.157.d: "The Zeppelin LZ 14, recently transferred to the Imperial German Navy and designated L-1, tragically crashed into the North Sea during a training mission. The airship, which had departed under adverse weather conditions with 20 individuals aboard, encountered severe gales and cold rain that caused its gas to contract. As a result, L-1 settled into the sea approximately 20 miles from Helgoland, ultimately breaking in two. Thirteen people perished when the control car sank, while seven were successfully rescued by motor torpedo boats."
ww1_germanrework.157.a: "Hopefully, this tragedy will not be repeated."

ww1_germanrework.158.t: "Johannisthal Air Disaster"
ww1_germanrework.158.d: "The Imperial German Navy's L 2 airship, designated LZ 18, was involved in a catastrophic test flight accident, resulting in the deaths of all 28 individuals aboard, including military personnel and crew.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 AM local time, during routine maneuvers near Johannisthal Air Field, a venting of hydrogen gas was accidentally ignited by the forward engine, leading to a massive explosion. Eyewitnesses reported a loud blast followed by the airship going down in flames from an altitude of 270 meters.\n\n. Among the deceased were members of the admiralty trial board, including seven officers who were closely associated with Kaiser Wilhelm. The pilot, Captain Gluth, was known for his extensive service with Count Zeppelin.\n\nThe only survivor, Lieut. Baron von Bieul, was a guest on board but succumbed to severe injuries. The wreckage was discovered scattered across the crash site, with remains of passengers found as far as a quarter-mile away."
ww1_germanrework.158.a: "Another airship disaster?!"

ww1_germanrework.159.d: "The Imperial German Navy's L 2 airship, tragically exploded during a test flight, killing all 28 onboard, including passengers and crew.\nAt around 10:30 AM, vented hydrogen gas ignited in the forward engine, causing a catastrophic explosion. The airship crashed near Johannisthal Air Field, southeast of Berlin, just over a month after the Helgoland Island disaster.\nWitnesses described a loud explosion and flames as the L-2, intended to be Germany's flagship, descended from 270 meters.\nUpon reaching the crash site, onlookers found twisted wreckage, and the sole survivor, Lieut. Baron von Bieul, suffered fatal injuries. The explosion violently ejected the passengers from the gondola, with remains found a quarter-mile away."

ww1_germanrework.160.d: "Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover married Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia, uniting the Hohenzollern and Hanover royal families after a decades-long feud. The wedding marked a significant moment, attracting a gathering of European sovereigns, including Kaiser Wilhelm II, King George V of the United Kingdom, and Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nThe union was born from a heartfelt gesture of condolence from Emperor Wilhelm II following the tragic death of Georg Wilhelm, Hereditary Prince of Hanover in an automobile accident in 1912. Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Cumberland's only surviving son, traveled to Berlin to express gratitude and ultimately fell in love with the emperor's daughter.\n\nErnest Augustus pledged allegiance to the German Empire and took on a military role within the Prussian Army. \n\nIn a gesture of goodwill, the Kaiser granted a royal pardon to two imprisoned British spies as a wedding gift.

The german government denied its responsability, indicating they didnt comitted such attack, but evidence point out they lied. This terrible accident is likely caused by the unrestricted submarine warfare doctrine, causing the german ships to engage pretty much any target on sight, including us.

The Admiralty hails it as a triumph of naval strategy. Yet unease spreads in the Foreign Office—over a hundred Americans were aboard.

ww1_german_revolution.1.d: "The revolution that began in Kiel has swept across Germany. In Berlin, massive demonstrations have paralyzed the capital. Barracks have been thrown open, arms have been distributed, and revolutionary soldiers now march beside striking workers. On [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], the Kaiser's authority vanished. Workers' and Soldiers' Councils (Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte) have seized government buildings, telegraph stations, and transport hubs. The imperial administration has collapsed. The chancellor has resigned, and power has passed - not to a parliament, but to the councils. In the streets, red flags fly.\n\nIn this dire situation, Chancellor von Baden has handed the chancellorship to Friedrich Ebert of the SPD. What comes next is unclear, but Germany is now a republic in everything but name."

ww1_german_revolution.2.t: "Tensions Rise Between Socialists"
ww1_german_revolution.2.d: "Though the monarchy has fallen, Germany is far from united. The provisional government — a tenuous coalition between the Majority Social Democrats (MSPD) and the Independent Social Democrats (USPD) — is facing growing pressure from the radical left. The Spartacus League, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, calls for a full workers' republic on the Soviet model. Their rhetoric has become increasingly militant.\n\nMSPD leaders, including Chancellor Ebert, fear that the Spartakists may attempt to seize power by force. The USPD, though more sympathetic, is also alarmed by the possibility of an armed uprising that could plunge the country into civil war. In Berlin and other industrial centers, tensions are at a breaking point. Revolutionary councils grow more assertive, while armed Freikorps units begin to regroup.

In return, Ebert would recognize the authority of the officer corps and ensure the continuity of the military hierarchy.\n\nThis pact, though secret, represents a profound compromise: a republic defended by imperial generals, and a socialist leader relying on monarchist officers to suppress radical workers. For Ebert, the goal is clear: the revolution must not go further. Better a republic supported by the army than chaos delivered by the Spartacists."

# ww1_german_revolution.4.d: "What began as a strike and demonstration against the new government's cautious reforms has erupted into armed revolt. Spartacist militants, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, have occupied press buildings, set up barricades in Berlin, and declared the need for a Soviet-style republic.\n\nThe government, acting through the Council of the People's Deputies, has responded with force. Relying not only on loyal army units but also on hastily assembled right-wing Freikorps volunteers, the revolt has been brutally suppressed after days of street fighting. The cost has been immense. Hundreds are dead, including unarmed workers. Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were captured, beaten, and executed extrajudicially.\n\nThough order has returned to Berlin, the price is national division. The government has alienated much of the revolutionary left, and the alliance with nationalist paramilitaries will not soon be forgotten."

ww1_german_revolution.4.d: "With Berlin still gripped by unrest and fresh bloodshed in the streets, the elected National Assembly has gathered in the tranquil city of Weimar. It is here, far from the chaos, that the future of the German state shall be forged. Delegates from across the fractured political spectrum — social democrats, centrists, liberals — have convened to draft a constitution, rebuild government institutions, and give the republic a legitimate foundation. Though the monarchy is gone and the empire dissolved, Germany's path remains uncertain. But from the modest halls of Weimar, a new hope rises: a republic born not of conquest or tradition, but of compromise.\n\nWhatever name history gives to this new state, its first breath is taken here — in Weimar."

ww1_german_revolution.5.t: "The Republic Takes Form in Weimar"
ww1_german_revolution.5.d: "Following the historic gathering of the National Assembly in Weimar, the new German Republic is beginning to take shape. Friedrich Ebert, long a pillar of the Majority Social Democratic Party, has been elected as the first President of the Republic.\n\nAlongside him, Philipp Scheidemann has been appointed Minister-President, tasked with forming the new government and steering the country through its post-war reconstruction. Their moderate, parliamentary leadership is widely seen as a stabilizing force in these uncertain times.\n\nThough many challenges lie ahead, the formation of this civilian government marks a vital step toward democratic order."

Former officers, demobilized soldiers, and nationalist volunteers are organizing themselves into paramilitary units — the Freikorps.\n\nOstensibly created to protect the Republic from Bolshevik uprisings and street unrest, these formations often operate with their own agendas. At the same time, veterans’ leagues are proliferating, uniting men scarred by war in search of camaraderie, purpose — and sometimes revenge.\n\nThough useful in the short term, these forces may prove volatile in the future."

ww1_german_revolution.7.t: "Scheidemann Resigns Over Versailles"
ww1_german_revolution.7.d: "Philipp Scheidemann has resigned after refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles, declaring that 'such a peace is unacceptable to any honest German.' His departure reflects the profound moral and political crisis gripping the young Republic.\n\nWith the threat of resumed hostilities looming, the National Assembly has appointed Gustav Bauer to lead a new government.

The document enshrines civil liberties, universal suffrage, and a federal structure — marking a decisive break from the past.\n\nThis step is seen by many observers as a foundation for renewed democratic governance in a nation still reeling from war, revolution, and social unrest. Whether the new republic can endure the mounting pressures it faces remains uncertain — but for now, a legal order has been restored."

#Focuses

#Starting Political Tree
GER_wilhelmine_germany: "The Wilhelmine Era"
GER_wilhelmine_germany_desc: "Since Kaiser Wilhelm II's ascension to the throne in 1888, a new era has dawned in Germany. While the Kaiser's dismissal of Bismarck's careful diplomacy has led to increasing tensions with Britain and Russia, his domestic policies have shown a more progressive intent. Wilhelm's support for workers' rights and opposition to Bismarck's anti-socialist laws have earned him some popular support. Above all, the Kaiser dreams of expanding Germany's colonial empire and securing the nation's rightful 'place in the sun.'"
GER_freie_volksbuhne: "Die Freie Volksbühne"
GER_freie_volksbuhne_desc: "Founded in 1890 by Bruno Wille, 'Die Freie Volksbühne' (The People's Free Theater) represents a triumph of social democratic culture despite the Anti-Socialist Laws. This workers' theater brings art to the proletariat and serves as a reminder that even under political repression, the social democratic movement endures. While the Kaiser's government may rest easy, we Social Democrats will demonstrate that change is not merely possible - it is inevitable."
GER_a_new_colonial_secretary: "A New Colonial Secretary"
GER_a_new_colonial_secretary_desc: "Dissatisfaction with the current direction of colonial affairs necessitates a change. Appointing a new Colonial Secretary is essential to potentially implement new strategies and ensure our colonial administration meets our national objectives more effectively."
GER_productional_efficiency: "Ruthless Colonial Exploitation"
GER_productional_efficiency_desc: "Despite Colonial Secretary Solf's preference for measured policies, pressure from industrial interests demands more aggressive exploitation of our colonial resources. By expanding industrial facilities and intensifying resource extraction, we can significantly increase output - though such measures will likely provoke local resistance and increase the risk of sabotage. The promise of greater profits must be weighed against the cost of maintaining order."
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposits: "Nationalize Colonial Diamond Deposits"
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposits_desc: "The diamond deposits in German South-West Africa represent immense potential wealth, yet private companies have proven inefficient in their exploitation. Following Colonial Secretary Solf's recommendations for increased efficiency, we shall establish a state-controlled organization to manage these valuable resources directly."
GER_organise_german_settlement: "Promote Colonial Settlement"
GER_organise_german_settlement_desc: "The success of our colonial mission requires a strong German presence in our overseas territories. By organizing systematic settlement programs, we can establish communities of German settlers who will serve as cultural bridges. Through daily interaction and commerce, the native populations will naturally gravitate toward German customs and values."
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies: "Congo Basin Cooperation"
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies_desc: "The Belgian Congo's vast mineral wealth presents an opportunity for mutual benefit. By establishing partnerships with Belgian companies operating along our colonial borders, we can develop more efficient resource extraction methods and secure a share of the region's prosperity for the Reich."
GER_finance_african_railways: "Fund the Colonial Railways"
GER_finance_african_railways_desc: "We will expand railway networks across our African colonies to secure rapid troop movements and reliable supply lines. At the same time, these lines will bolster local trade and channel vital resources back to Germany."
GER_foster_colonial_cooperation: "Foster Colonial Cooperation"
GER_foster_colonial_cooperation_desc: "In an effort to guarantee our overall effectiveness in our foreign empire leadership and subjects in general, we will address efficiency issues hindering colonial leadership. By promoting cooperation between our German mainland and colonial areas within our empire, we will reaffirm leadership and improve conduct of affairs."
GER_consolidate_pacific_holdings: "Consolidate our Pacific Holdings"
GER_consolidate_pacific_holdings_desc: "Our pacific colonies have recently been shown to have unease in our current governance. We shall work further towards easing them closer towards compliance and allegiance to us."
GER_forge_the_pacific_network: "Forge the Pacific Network"
GER_forge_the_pacific_network_desc: "Our leadership, as well as companies that finance our colonial empire, seeks to establish a German-influenced network in Asia based around our colonial outreach on the continent; we will invigorate that objective."
GER_musterkolonie_kiautschou: "Musterkolonie Kiautschou"
GER_musterkolonie_kiautschou_desc: "The Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory, Germany's holdings in China, is a critically important location according to the German leadership, as it suffered less from land speculation than the other colonies in the empire, making it a valuable investment option."
GER_healthcare_reforms: "Healthcare Reforms"
GER_healthcare_reforms_desc: "The rapid industrialization of our cities has created pockets of unemployment and social disruption. This comprehensive legislation will establish mechanisms to direct labor where it is most needed, particularly in our growing industrial sectors. The act will help manage the challenges of urbanization while ensuring economic efficiency."
GER_hausarbeitsgesetz: "Hausarbeitsgesetz"
GER_hausarbeitsgesetz_desc: "The 'Household Tasks Act' is the first form of recognition for homeworkers. Contrary to what its name suggests, this proposed regulation affects all homeworkers, such as artisans or sculptors. It regulates the safety, status, and payment of these workers."
GER_conduct_a_national_census: "Imperial Census Initiative"
GER_conduct_a_national_census_desc: "A thorough census of the Reich is essential for modern governance. While the data may reveal concerning trends in our urban centers, it will provide crucial information for policy-making. The financial cost is justified by the valuable insights we will gain into our nation's demographic and social conditions."
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension: "Bethmann Hollweg's Pension Reform"
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension_desc: "Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg has proposed comprehensive reforms to the Reich's pension system. His plan would increase benefits and extend coverage to ethnic minorities within the empire. While conservatives denounce the inclusion of non-Germans in the system, these reforms would stimulate consumer spending and promote social stability."
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives: "Agricultural Modernization Program"
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives_desc: "The migration to urban centers has left our agricultural sector struggling with labor shortages.

ww1_german_victory.1.d: "With victory secured and our enemies forced to the negotiating table, questions are now being raised in Berlin — and across the Reich — about the future of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL).\n\nCreated to oversee the war effort and led to great effect by generals like Hindenburg and Ludendorff, the OHL has accumulated immense power, often acting independently of civilian authority. Some argue that its continued existence is necessary to ensure postwar security and suppress unrest.\n\nOthers, particularly within the Reichstag and among constitutionalists, argue that the war is over — and that the military must return to its proper place under civilian control."
ww1_german_victory.1.a: "Maintain the OHL — stability demands continued military oversight."
ww1_german_victory.1.b: "Dissolve the OHL — the war is over, power returns to the Reichstag."


ww1_german_victory.2.t: "Military Opposition to the Dissolution of the OHL"
ww1_german_victory.2.d: "The decision to dissolve the Oberste Heeresleitung has provoked sharp criticism within the officer corps. General Ludendorff, in particular, has voiced his outrage, claiming that dissolving the wartime command in the wake of victory is a betrayal of the army's achievements.\n\nSome officers have called for the preservation of military influence over national policy, but they remain a minority. The majority of the political class, and even key figures within the army, recognize that civilian leadership must be restored. Ludendorff and a handful of hardliners have been quietly dismissed or reassigned to honorary posts."
ww1_german_victory.2.a: "The military returns to the barracks."


ww1_german_victory.3.t: "Mass Protests for Democratic Reforms"
ww1_german_victory.3.d: "Victory in the war has brought pride to the Empire but not peace at home. Across Berlin, Dresden, the Ruhr, and Königsberg, crowds have taken to the streets calling for long-delayed democratic reforms.\n\nAmong the loudest demands: the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia, stronger civil representation in imperial governance, and urgent action to address postwar inflation and inequality. Many protest peacefully, but strikes and agitation are spreading fast. Even as banners wave in triumph for the Fatherland, others demand that victory be followed by justice — and real democracy."

ww1_german_victory.4.d: "Following the wave of democratic protests, a second and more determined movement has taken shape. Major industrial centers across Germany — from the Ruhr to Saxony — are now paralyzed by strikes.\n\nProtesters are no longer content with promises of reform. They demand immediate national elections, a total restructuring of the imperial parliament, and urgent domestic reforms, including labor protections, housing programs, and price controls.\n\nEven within moderate parties, pressure is building to respond before the movement radicalizes further. The Reich cannot afford to appear deaf to its own people — not after victory."

He assured listeners that democratic reforms — including parliamentary adjustments and greater civic representation — would be introduced in an orderly and deliberate fashion.\n\nCalling for unity and discipline, the Kaiser urged the public to trust in the wisdom of the Crown and to avoid agitation that might threaten the nation’s hard-won victory."
ww1_german_victory.5.a: "A measured voice in a turbulent time."

ww1_german_victory.6.t: "Elections Planned Amid Military Dissent"
ww1_german_victory.6.d: "As preparations begin for the anticipated national elections — promised by His Imperial Majesty in his recent address — tensions are once again surfacing within the old military establishment.\n\nThough officially retired from influence, General Erich Ludendorff and several hardline conservatives have issued public criticisms of the electoral process, accusing the government of surrendering authority to populists and socialists. Their words resonate within nationalist veterans’ circles and reactionary newspapers.\n\nDespite their removal from power, these voices continue to echo through the corridors of the old officer corps — and cannot be entirely ignored."

ww1_german_victory.7.d: "With peace secured abroad but hardship continuing at home, the government has announced the creation of a new Imperial Committee for National Reconstruction.\n\nTasked with assessing wartime damage, restoring critical infrastructure, and preventing famine in the hardest-hit regions, the committee brings together civil engineers, local officials, and military logistics officers. It is empowered to coordinate emergency repairs to railways, housing, and food distribution systems.\n\nThough some view it as a temporary measure, others see it as the beginning of a modern, centralized approach to social welfare and economic recovery."

ww1_german_victory.9.d: "Before the war, Germany had agreed to construct four modern destroyers for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Though the conflict delayed their delivery, the armistice and ensuing peace have now made it possible to resume the project.\n\nSeen as a gesture of goodwill and naval reliability, the delivery strengthens ties with the Netherlands and showcases Germany’s postwar industrial recovery."
ww1_german_victory.9.a: "Our shipyards fulfill their promise at last."

ww1_german_victory.10.t: "German Destroyers Arrive"
ww1_german_victory.10.d: "Years ago, our government commissioned four modern destroyers from German shipyards. The war disrupted the contract, and many feared the vessels would never be completed. Yet today, the ships have finally arrived in our harbors. The delivery is seen as a diplomatic gesture and a sign of restored trust. Our fleet is strengthened, and relations with Berlin subtly improved."
ww1_german_victory.10.a: "A welcome addition to our navy."

ww1_german_victory.11.t: "The March Reforms"
ww1_german_victory.11.d: "With Ludendorff dismissed, the Reichstag has passed the sweeping Märzreformen of 1920. These grant new powers to parliament: ministers may now serve as deputies, war declarations require legislative consent, and the Reichskanzler must enjoy Reichstag confidence. Civilian control over military appointments is expanded. The Privy Council is abolished, and Alsace-Lorraine is granted statehood under Duke Franz of Bavaria. Germany takes a bold step toward constitutional monarchy."

ww1_german_victory.12.t: "A New Economic Partnership?"
ww1_german_victory.12.d: "With free elections now concluded and a naval treaty freshly signed, Berlin seeks to deepen ties with Washington through economic cooperation. The German government has proposed a long-term trade agreement: steel and mining exports from the Ruhr in exchange for American grain and agricultural surplus. For the Reich, this is both a diplomatic overture and a strategic step to build national food reserves."
ww1_german_victory.12.a: "Steel for bread—an alliance of prosperity."
ww1_german_victory.12.b: "A good german is a starving german!"

ww1_german_victory.13.t: "Deal Signed with the United States"
ww1_german_victory.13.d: "After weeks of negotiation, Washington has formally accepted our trade proposal. A new agreement secures regular exports of German coal and steel in exchange for American food supplies and machinery. This marks a milestone in German-American cooperation and helps stabilize both our industrial output and national food stockpiles."
ww1_german_victory.13.a: "A promising start to economic diplomacy."

ww1_german_victory.14.t: "Washington Declines Our Offer"
ww1_german_victory.14.d: "Despite recent diplomatic warmth and a shared interest in stability, the U.S. has rejected our proposed economic partnership.

The refusal is a setback, but Berlin remains committed to securing other trade partners and ensuring food security through alternative means."

Though the country retains a nominal government, its economy is subordinated to Berlin's needs. Railways, ports, and key industries fall under German oversight.

Yet in France, memories of occupation, humiliation, and the Treaty of Frankfurt remain raw. The offer divides our leadership—some see opportunity, others betrayal.

With the monarchy crumbling and the Kaiser in exile, Germany finds itself with two visions of the future—and no clear path forward."
ww1_german_revolution.17.a: "In the end there will be only one Republic."

ww1_german_revolution.18.t2: "The [GetMonth] Crisis"
ww1_german_revolution.18.d: "Tensions exploded in Berlin when government forces attempted to disband the Volksmarinedivision, a leftist militia occupying the Berlin Palace. The marines refused to stand down, leading to street battles, deaths, and a humiliating retreat of loyal troops. Ebert's government survives, but trust between the SPD and the radical left is shattered. The young Republic now teeters on the edge of civil war."
ww1_german_revolution.18.a: "We are barely holding this republic together."

ww1_german_revolution.19.t: "Upper Silesia Partialy Transferred to Poland"
ww1_german_revolution.19.d: "Following the chaos of the Third Silesian Uprising and mounting Polish pressure, the League of Nations has ruled in favor of transferring a part of Upper Silesia region to Poland. The decision is hailed in Warsaw as a diplomatic victory and a step toward national unification. However, German protests are growing louder, and the region’s mixed population may yet turn this gain into a new source of conflict."
ww1_german_revolution.19.a: "Silesia is ours!"

ww1_german_nazism.2.t: "Formation of the National Socialist German Workers' Party"
ww1_german_nazism.2.d: "After giving his first speech for the DAP, Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator. Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership as crowds began to flock to hear his speeches. Such was the popularity of Hitler's speaking skills, the party began charging an entry fee for visitors to hear his speeches.\n\nThe small number of party members were quickly won over to Hitler's political beliefs. He organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people in a beer hall in Munich. Further in an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party."

ww1_germanrework.171.d: "The Reichstag remains deadlocked over the 1912 imperial budget. Disputes between conservatives and progressives over taxation, military spending, and social reform have paralyzed the process. The government now finds itself without a functioning budget, sparking a constitutional crisis. With legitimacy wavering, the Chancellor Hollweg must choose: resign and allow a new coalition to form—or request emergency authority and try to force a compromise."
ww1_germanrework.171.a: "Resign! The Reichstag has spoken."  
ww1_germanrework.171.b: "This can still be resolved."

ww1_germanrework.172.t: "Budget Deadlock Continues"
ww1_germanrework.172.d: "Three months have passed, and still no budget has been approved. Negotiations have collapsed entirely. With the Reichstag paralyzed and the government unable to command a majority, the Chancellor has submitted his resignation. In response, the Kaiser has invoked his prerogative to enforce a provisional budget—one crafted by the military and conservative ministries, prioritizing armament and order over reform."

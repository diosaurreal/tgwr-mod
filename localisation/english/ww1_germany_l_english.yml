According to it, Germany is a federation of 25 states, each with their own limited rights and self-governance, but all under the permanent presidency of Prussia. The title of king of Prussia is synonymous with the title of Kaiser but even he does not govern absolutely. The Bundesrat, Germany's 'upper house' is made up of representatives of the various states, and the Reichstag, Germany's 'lower house', is led by the chancellor who is second only to the Kaiser.\n\nWhile seemingly a strong foundation of democracy, the German constitution in reality still allows for unprecedented levels of power for any constitutional monarch. With the Kaiser being able to appoint the Chancellor, allowing him to dictate what laws are proposed and vetoed in the Reichstag."

#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t:0 "Germany's Disgrace"
 ww1_germanrework.1.d:0 "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."

 ww1_germanrework.2.d:0 "In a bold and decisive move, Kaiser Wilhelm II has appointed Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa as the new Chancellor of the German Empire. A figure renowned for his staunch conservatism and unwavering dedication to the Prussian ideals, von Heydebrand's ascent marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the empire.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Ernst von Heydebrand has long been a prominent voice in the German Conservative Party. His career has been characterized by a fervent advocacy for the preservation of traditional German values and institutions. A fierce opponent of liberalism and socialism, von Heydebrand has consistently championed policies that strengthen the monarchy, the military, and the agrarian interests that form the backbone of his support.\n\nVon Heydebrand's tenure is expected to usher in an era of intensified conservative governance. With a reputation for his iron will and unyielding principles, he is anticipated to reinforce the Kaiser's vision of a strong, unified Germany, poised to assert its influence on the European stage. However, his appointment is not without controversy, as it risks deepening the divides within the Reichstag and among the populace, who are increasingly restless with the status quo."
 ww1_germanrework.2.a:0 "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t:0 "Factions in the Right"
 ww1_germanrework.19.d:0 "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like von Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."

#1910 Strikes

 ww1_germanrework.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."

(recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."

The Social Democrat, Adolf Hofmann told the representatives that the Kaiser already received a daily income of 43,065 marks without the proposed increase. This criticism of the rise infuriated the centrists and right-wing of the house, with the President of the House calling Hofmann a 'traitor'. While the increase is still sure to pass the SPD's revisionist wing has been put under scrutiny from the right after their seemingly 'traitorous' stance on the matter."

The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."

The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has come to the support of the strikes, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers, the centrists have already shifted to the right in response, proposing financial aid to the owners of the mines to make up for their losses."

These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t:0 "Wilhelmine Germany"
 ww1_germanrework.21.d:0 "The dawn of Wilhelmine Germany marked a new era of industrial prowess and ambitious imperialism under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II - ascending to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm II sought to propel Germany into the ranks of global superpowers, adopting a policy of Weltpolitik to expand German influence and secure a 'place in the sun.'\n\nThe economy flourished with rapid industrialization throughout the second industrial revolution, making Germany a leader in steel production, chemicals, and electrical engineering. This industrial boom fostered a burgeoning middle class and significant urbanization, transforming the societal landscape. This allowed Wilhelm to sanction the expansion of the German navy under admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, reflecting his aspirations for a formidable maritime presence to rival that of Great Britain.\n\nInternally, during the Wilhelmine period Germany witnessed the rise of the Social Democratic Party, representing the growing working class and advocating for more radical social reforms. This rise of the left poses challenges to the conservative establishment, necessitating a delicate balance between modernization and maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nOn the international stage, Germany's assertive foreign policy aimed at colonial expansion and securing alliances created tensions with other European powers - something that has led Germany to become diplomatically isolated and even 'encircled' by the triple entente. However, the formation of the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy still stands and in those two powers, Germany still has some friends left within the content.\n\nFor now, Wilhelmine Germany stands as a testament to the industrial strength of Germany, and her resolve through the many crises she has, and will, face."

Unlike the right wing of the Reichstag, the left is mostly unified under the SPD with both moderate social democrats and revisionist republicans holding seats for the party's faction. However, the FVp's faction in the Reichstag also holds significant sway in the leftist wing.\n\nOutside of the Reichstag the workers of Germany are significantly unionized under moderate worker's unions - as of late the unions have become more and more restless, and working conditions in the industries have slowly declined with Germany's rise in demand. If not dealt with properly the unions have the power to cripple the economy, the government's saving grace is that the unions are decentralized without a common purpose, allowing the chancellor to make slower reforms that won't upset either the balance of power or the right-wing of the Reichstag."

 ww1_germanrework.23.d:0 "Germany's right wing has always been favored by both the aristocracy and farmers, composed of conservative, agricultural, and nationalist parties. However, the decline of right-wing has become more and more clear as the second industrial revolution catalyzed the formation of leftist unions and bolstered support for the Social Democrats. Due to this many of the conservative parties have begun to adapt their policies to ensure they can keep their key voter's support; the conservatives continue to advocate for a self-sufficient economy less reliant on trade, especially with nations like Britain who pose a threat to German ambitions and the agriculturists call for tax exemptions for farmers to give them the support they need to feed the newly urbanized populations. If the right-wing is to revive itself it must set a clear goal that the rightist parties can follow, or else the right will be crushed under the tide of social democracy."

Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."

 ww1_germanrework.40.d:0 "After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Prussian Army, Royal Saxon Army, Army of Württemberg and the Bavarian Army were autonomous in peacetime, each kingdom maintaining a separate war ministry and general staff to administer their forces. On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire ensures that the German Emperor would be made commander-in-chief of the combined armies.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Oberste Heeresleitung is now the highest echelon of command of the Heer of the German Empire, led by general Moltke. The OHL is split into sections that will take control over different parts of the country, whilst also monitoring politics and taking over the economy to ensure production remains most efficient for the army.\n\nIn addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consists of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers.

 ww1_germanrework.41.d:0 "The Centre of Germany has been the dominant force in the Empire's governing politics since its creation. The centrists are led by the trusted Zentrum party who formed in 1870, went on to successfully battle against the Kulturkampf waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. However, there are plenty of centrist parties in Germany who seek to make moderate social reform whilst ensuring that German traditional values are kept.\n\nIf Germany is going to continue to be stable throughout the next decade, the centrists must keep their power in Germany so that a moderate amount of rightist and leftist laws are passed into the bundesrat. Luckily, many of the key political figures in Germany, like Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, support the centrists and have aided them in keeping their majority in the Reichstag. "

 ww1_germanrework.42.d:0 "Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein their goals were never truly achieved. After the unification, from the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, who since 1891 were organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, even calling for the annexation of Austria. The organization has greatly supported the educated middle and upper class; promoting German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, "Deutsche Politik" (1905-07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe which many of the League have taken to heart.\n\nHowever, since the dawn of this new millennium, the Pan-Germans have taken a moderate stance to Austria, instead focusing on annexations in Russia and France. It seems for now the Pan-Germans have abandoned the annexationist policy around Austria."

Whilst we have begun Germanisation efforts in the areas of the empire occupied by Danes and Poles, there is still a silent cultural resistance against our rule in these areas. This issue of minorities on German land has led to conflicts on how the minorities should be treated by the government, currently Polish and Danish minorities can apply for German citizenship, but some centrists and leftists, including Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg want to expand the rights of minorities to ensure they can claim the same insurances and state benefits than any other German citizens can. On the other hand, the rightist factions in the Reichstag have instead proposed that minority citizenship have their 'perks' reduced to allow the government to use more fund towards the betterment of 'real' Germans."

Whilst this does not mean Hollweg is being forced to step down, especically as the Kaiser shows no willingness to remove Hollweg, if Hollweg does choose to continue on it will highlight the facade of German 'democracy' and will surley tarnish the chancellor's reputation."

ww1_germanrework.33.d:0 "The time has finally come and the British diplomats have arrived in Germany. Upon their arrival, a memorandum, prepared by Sir Edward Grey, Winston Churchill, and Lloyd George, was given to the Kaiser. This memorandum outlined 3 proposals:\n\n1. Fundamental. Naval superiority was recognized as essential to Great Britain. Present German naval program and expenditure not to be increased, but if possible retarded and reduced.\n2. England sincerely desires not to interfere with German Colonial expansion. To give effect to this she is prepared forthwith to discuss whatever the German aspirations in that direction may be. England will be glad to know that there is a field or special points where she can help Germany.\n3. Proposals for reciprocal assurances debarring either power from joining in aggressive designs or combinations against the other would be welcome.\n\nIt's clear that the main goal of the British is to secure their naval dominance, an expected aim. However, they were also clearly willing to offer major concessions, the Kaiser and his advisors were extremely interested in the clause that would allow Germany to pursue further colonial goals. On top of this, Hollweg is especially pleased with the third clause that would suggest that the UK and Germany could even pursue further treaties.\n\nHowever, this visit took a turn for the worse when, under the influence of Tirpitz, Wilhelm pushed for a new naval bill to be passed in the Reichstag. This seemingly anti-British expansion has sent the diplomats packing and any chance of detente, dead in the water. Chancellor Hollweg is sure to be furious; his work has been scuppered."

GER_wilhelmine_germany_desc:0 "Since Kaiser Wilhelm II's ascension to the throne in 1888, a new era has dawned in Germany. While the Kaiser's dismissal of Bismarck's careful diplomacy has led to increasing tensions with Britain and Russia, his domestic policies have shown a more progressive intent. Wilhelm's support for workers' rights and opposition to Bismarck's anti-socialist laws have earned him some popular support. Above all, the Kaiser dreams of expanding Germany's colonial empire and securing the nation's rightful 'place in the sun.'"

GER_freie_volksbuhne_desc:0 "Founded in 1890 by Bruno Wille, 'Die Freie Volksbühne' (The People's Free Theater) represents a triumph of social democratic culture despite the Anti-Socialist Laws. This workers' theater brings art to the proletariat and serves as a reminder that even under political repression, the social democratic movement endures. While the Kaiser's government may rest easy, we Social Democrats will demonstrate that change is not merely possible - it is inevitable."

His pragmatic approach emphasizes cultural assimilation and improved living standards in the colonies rather than brutal suppression. This appointment would satisfy both conservative and liberal factions, as Solf's methods promise stability without sacrificing efficiency."

By expanding industrial facilities and intensifying resource extraction, we can significantly increase output - though such measures will likely provoke local resistance and increase the risk of sabotage.

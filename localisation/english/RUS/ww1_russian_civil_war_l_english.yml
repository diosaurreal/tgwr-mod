The Komuch's immediate goal is to strengthen the authority of the Constituent Assembly and create a National Army to fight the external enemy. In the area of foreign policy... it remains loyal to its allies and rejects any thought of a separate peace, and therefore does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

 komuch.1.t: "Order No. 1"
 komuch.1.d: "In the name of the Constituent Assembly, the Bolshevik government in Samara and Samara Province is declared deposed. All commissars are dismissed from their positions. The local government bodies dissolved by the Soviet government—city councils and zemstvo councils—are restored in full, and are ordered to return to work immediately. All restrictions and curtailments of freedom imposed by the Bolshevik authorities are lifted, and freedom of speech, press, assembly, and rallies is restored. Commissars and heads of Soviet enterprises are required to hand over all work within three days to the newly restored bodies, as appropriate, or to persons appointed by the Committee. The Revolutionary Tribunal, as an organ that does not conform to true popular democratic principles, is abolished, and the district people's court is restored. A united, independent, free Russia. All power to the Constituent Assembly. These are the slogans and goals of the new revolutionary government."
 komuch.1.a: "All power to the People!"

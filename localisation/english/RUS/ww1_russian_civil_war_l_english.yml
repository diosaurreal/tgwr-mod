 #Komuch
 komuch.1.t: "Order No. 1"
 komuch.1.d: "In the name of the Constituent Assembly, the Bolshevik government in Samara and Samara Province is declared deposed. All commissars are dismissed from their positions. The local government bodies dissolved by the Soviet government—city councils and zemstvo councils—are restored in full, and are ordered to return to work immediately. All restrictions and curtailments of freedom imposed by the Bolshevik authorities are lifted, and freedom of speech, press, assembly, and rallies is restored. Commissars and heads of Soviet enterprises are required to hand over all work within three days to the newly restored bodies, as appropriate, or to persons appointed by the Committee. The Revolutionary Tribunal, as an organ that does not conform to true popular democratic principles, is abolished, and the district people's court is restored. A united, independent, free Russia. All power to the Constituent Assembly. These are the slogans and goals of the new revolutionary government."
 komuch.1.a: "All power to the People!"
 komuch.2.t: "Question of the All-Russian Government"
 komuch.2.d: "One of the things we have to decide in setting up the All-Russian Government is whether to recognise the Constituent Assembly set up in Bolshevik-controlled Russia.\nThe Bolsheviks had thought they would win the election because the Russian people recognised the Bolshevik dictatorship, but the Constituent Assembly had been set up in which the Socialist Revolutionary Party had won the most votes. The Bolsheviks dissolved it and made it disappear, but some of the members of the Constituent Assembly continue to fight against the Bolsheviks in the form of the so-called Komuch, the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly.\nIf we recognise the Constituent Assembly in the formation of the All-Russian Government, it means that parliamentary power will be transferred to them."
 komuch.2.a: "Form All-Russian government with Siberia"
 komuch.2.b: "We don't negotiatate with reactionaries"

 komuch.4.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] replied that they could not recognise the legitimacy of the Constituent Assembly. The negotiations broke down and the offer was rejected."
 komuch.4.a: "They go against the will of the People!"
 komuch.6.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Submission"
 komuch.6.d: "The Provisional All-Russian Government set up in Siberia has demanded our submission, claiming that they are the true successors to the legitimate Russian government and that our local government is an illegitimate attempt at independence."
 #Izhevsk
 ww1_izhevsk.1.t: "Organization of government"
 ww1_izhevsk.1.d: "With the city liberated from Bolshevik tyranny, the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Workers' Uprising stands at a crossroads. To secure our future and legitimacy, we must immediately form a provisional government to organize our defense and administration. For the broader struggle against the Reds, we recognize the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly in Samara as the legal authority in Russia. Our fate is now tied to the cause of a free, democratic Russia."

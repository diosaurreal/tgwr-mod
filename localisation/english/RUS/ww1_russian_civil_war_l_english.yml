 KOM_consolidate_power_desc: "The coup we carried out thanks to the arrival of valiant Czechoslovak troops to Samara was carried out in the name of the great principle of popular sovereignty and Russia's independence. The Komuch's immediate goal is to strengthen the authority of the Constituent Assembly and create a National Army to fight the external enemy. In the area of foreign policy... it remains loyal to its allies and rejects any thought of a separate peace, and therefore does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

 #Komuch
 komuch.1.t: "Order No. 1"
 komuch.1.d: "In the name of the Constituent Assembly, the Bolshevik government in Samara and Samara Province is declared deposed. All commissars are dismissed from their positions. The local government bodies dissolved by the Soviet government—city councils and zemstvo councils—are restored in full, and are ordered to return to work immediately. All restrictions and curtailments of freedom imposed by the Bolshevik authorities are lifted, and freedom of speech, press, assembly, and rallies is restored. Commissars and heads of Soviet enterprises are required to hand over all work within three days to the newly restored bodies, as appropriate, or to persons appointed by the Committee. The Revolutionary Tribunal, as an organ that does not conform to true popular democratic principles, is abolished, and the district people's court is restored. A united, independent, free Russia. All power to the Constituent Assembly. These are the slogans and goals of the new revolutionary government."
 komuch.1.a: "All power to the People!"
 #Izhevsk
 ww1_izhevsk.1.t: "Organization of government"
 ww1_izhevsk.1.d: "With the city liberated from Bolshevik tyranny, the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Workers' Uprising stands at a crossroads. To secure our future and legitimacy, we must immediately form a provisional government to organize our defense and administration. For the broader struggle against the Reds, we recognize the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly in Samara as the legal authority in Russia. Our fate is now tied to the cause of a free, democratic Russia."
 ww1_izhevsk.1.a: "Let's end this chaos"
 ww1_izhevsk.2.t: "Reinforcements to the People's Army"
 ww1_izhevsk.2.d: "People join our army, both ordinary workers and veterans of the Great War, with the desire to fight against the Bolsheviks. We also got additional equipment after serious clashes with the enemies."
 ww1_izhevsk.2.a: "Great!"
 ww1_izhevsk.3.d: "Recently declared mobilization increases our army, although this leads to its moral degradation."
 ww1_izhevsk.3.a: "Well..."
 ww1_izhevsk.4.t: "Forced mobilization"
 ww1_izhevsk.4.d: "What an irony! We raised an uprising against the mobilization, but now we are forced to carry it out due to a shortage of people in the army. Is everything going according to plan?"
 ww1_izhevsk.4.a: "Anything against Bolshevism!"
 ww1_izhevsk.4.b: "No"
 ww1_izhevsk.5.t: "Question of the reforms of the Bolsheviks"
 ww1_izhevsk.5.d: "Even though we are fighting against the Reds, they have brought many new laws that the workers liked. Should we cancel them?"
 ww1_izhevsk.5.a: "Let's dont touch them"

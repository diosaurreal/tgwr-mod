 #Events
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.1.t: "All Russian Constituent Assembly Election"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.1.d: "We emerged with a strong urban foothold but failed to deliver a nation-wide mandate, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries, both Left and Right, performed far more strongly in the countryside, delivering substantial rural mandates in volosts and uyezds. Liberal parties, including the Kadets, fared poorly in many regions, their influence waning where peasant interests and agrarian reform dominated voting patterns; non-Bolshevik opposition was fragmented, with scattered pockets of support in provincial towns but little momentum against the central appeal of the Red banner in the urban centers."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.1.a: "Lenin was right, this was a liberal scheme!"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.2.d: "Bolsheviks emerged with a strong urban foothold but failed to deliver a nation-wide mandate, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries, both Left and Right, performed far more strongly in the countryside, delivering substantial rural mandates in volosts and uyezds. Liberal parties, including the Kadets, fared poorly in many regions, their influence waning where peasant interests and agrarian reform dominated voting patterns; non-Bolshevik opposition was fragmented, with scattered pockets of support in provincial towns but little momentum against the central appeal of the Red banner in the urban centers."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.2.a: "See? The Bolsheviks are illegitimate!"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.3.a: "We'll deal with them later."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.3.b: "The Bolshevik usurpation is coming to and end!"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.3.c: "How legitimate can these results really be?"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.4.t: "Demonstrations in Support of the Constituent Assembly"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.4.d: "Significant number of deputies were either arrested, forced to go "underground," or simply refused to participate in the convening of the Constituent Assembly. Rumors circulated about the dissolution of the assembly. In this situation, the Union for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly announced a march to the Tauride Palace to demonstrate its determination to defend democracy. The Council of People's Commissars' response was swift: the Petrograd Cheka, in particular Commissar Uritsky, decreed an immediate ban on all forms of marches, demonstrations, and public gatherings, and the government called on the population not to participate in the march. All newspapers calling for demonstrations and defense of the Constituent Assembly were closed.\nThe majority of the demonstration consisted of a gathering of students, civil servants, small shopkeepers, and workers. At 10:00 a.m., the gathering began, and the demonstrators began to gather en masse and spontaneously toward the Field of Mars. On their way there, the crowd of thousands of demonstrators encountered Red Guard fortifications at the intersection of Liteiny and Sergievskaya Streets, where soldiers ordered the unarmed demonstrators to disperse. In response, the crowd began singing the Marseillaise and waving red banners, continuing their march."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.4.a: "Open fire!"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.5.t: "Convocation of the Assembly"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.5.d: "The Assembly is dominated by anti-Bolshevik Esers and their leader Victor Chernov was elected Chairman of the Assembly with 244 votes against 153 for Maria Spiridonova of the Left Esers. The Bolsheviks placed the Second Soviet Congress' Decrees before the Assembly for endorsement. They were rejected by 237 votes to 136. It is thus clear that the Constituent Assembly is opposed to Soviet government and would not agree to new elections. In a recess, a special meeting of the Bolsheviks and Left Esers decided to dissolve the Assembly."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.5.a: "Enemies of the revolution."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.6.t: "Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly"
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.6.d: "The Commandant of the Tauride Palace, an Anarchist sailor called Anatoli Zhelezniakov, approached Chernov and said:\n"The guard is tired. I propose that you close the meeting and let everybody go home.\nThe Esers tried to use the final minutes of the Constituent Assembly to pass socialist measures which they had failed to implement in months of power in the Provisional Government. Chernov responded to the Soviet Decrees on Land and Peace with the Eser-drafted "Law on the Land", which proclaimed a radical land reform, a law making Russia a democratic federal republic and an appeal to the Entente Allies for a democratic peace. The Assembly voted for the proposals, scheduled the next meeting. The next day the deputies found the building locked down and the Assembly declared dissolved by the Bolshevik-Left Eser Soviet government."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.6.a: "They didn't last long."
 ww1_rus_constituent_assembly.7.d: "The Assembly was dominated by anti-Bolshevik Esers and their leader Victor Chernov was elected Chairman.

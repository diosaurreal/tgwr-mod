 ww1_army_effort_desc:0 "Many of our rifles, cannons, tools, and, unfortunately, military leaders are relics of a bygone era. With the Maxim Gun now not only fabricated, but on a large scale, we simply have no choice but to get with the times. The quicker we bring these new weapons into circulation, and bring in experts who know how to use them, the quicker our military can become a modern, effective fighting force."

 ww1_trenchwarfare:0 "Trench Warfare Focus"
 ww1_trenchwarfare_desc:0 "Since Gatling and Maxim introduced their unholy weapons of warfare, our nation has been keenly interested in strategies based around the defense of Trench lines, which were first seen as far back as the American Civil War. We must seek experts in this theory in order to advance our knowledge in tomorrow's Land Doctrines."

 ww1_artillery_effort_1:0 "Artillery Effort"
 ww1_artillery_effort_1_desc:0 "One step to expand our young military modernization program is further development of our Artillery batteries. Seeking out designers for new weapons is a logical first step, and once our project is completed, we expect to reap the benefits of an easily-designed new Artillery piece."

 ww1_artillery_effort_2:0 "Artillery Effort II"
 ww1_artillery_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered some accomplished Artillery designers, it seems logical to support their endeavors with their own factories. By assigning these men as full-time designers and engineers, and putting workers under them, we can easily make advancements in the field of Artillery."

 ww1_artillery_effort_3:0 "Artillery Effort III"
 ww1_artillery_effort_3_desc:0 "Field tests are proving a major issue with our artillery pieces: The wide variety of calibers we're using for various ranges and models of Artillery is proving a costly endeavor, and reducing the effectiveness of our pieces on the field. By enforcing a few standard sizes for our guns, we can produce new models of Artillery that give us, quite literally, more bang for our buck."

 ww1_artillery_effort_4:0 "Artillery Effort IV"
 ww1_artillery_effort_4_desc:0 "Though the direct-fire Field Gun was thought to be on its way out from the battlefield, our quartermasters are actually beginning to request even more of these pieces. Focusing our efforts on new direct-fire guns, and perhaps more types of rounds, will not only inevitably lead to superior models, but perhaps lead to some unexpected advantages elsewhere as well..."

 ww1_special_forces:0 "Special Forces Focus"
 ww1_special_forces_desc:0 "Chemical Warfare has, by sheer accident, introduced us to a class of excellent troops, superior to the other groups in our army. These men seem quite useful to act as classes of Infantry which are above the caliber of the standard Rifleman. Seeking out these men could lead to a boost to our special forces. If only there were some way to get them into battle faster..."

 ww1_army_motorization_focus:0 "Motorization Focus"
 ww1_army_motorization_focus_desc:0 "Some of our geniuses in the General Staff- or perhaps just men fed up with the stalemates of Trench Wafare- have proposed mass-producing vehicles specifically for troop transportation, which would allow our men to get to and from battlefields faster- and, perhaps, around it as well. Of course, even this simple act requires specific equipment and training, which means an investment- though one that could easily pay off."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_1:0 "Doctrine Effort I"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_1_desc:0 "Though the era of the General Staff consisting of the princes of the realm has long ended, several of our Generals and other officers were chosen for our armeis not for skill, but for connections or family ties. Though this keeps them loyal, it makes them uncompetitive. We must begin appointments for merit- though still, hopefully, not let too much of the common riff-raff into the esteemed General Staff..."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrine Effort II"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Though our General Staff has now been made thoroughly merit-based, they aren't the only ones who can assist in our doctrines. A type of researchers who have been mostly dormant since the early 1800s- ''armchair generals''- have organized once again. Though these men have limited combat experience, their study in war cannot be ignored. Integrating them could prove beneficial for our military tactics."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_3:0 "Doctrine Effort III"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "One of our critical elements of warfare has largely been ignored prior: Logistics. For troops to be useful in combat, we must ensure they arrive on time, and have, at least, food, water, and a weapon. Giving experts on this subject a voice, as well as training for supply vehicle drivers, would have immediate benefits for our land doctrines, but perhaps future additional benefits as well."

By selecting the most well-liked and in-tune officers, we can learn the faults of our current weapons, allowing us to produce corrected and improved designs quickly- as well as ensure that these men don't get TOO popular!"

 ww1_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Effort II" #Link me pls
 ww1_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our new Quartermasters have taken to us with requests for not simply newer rifles, but newer support weapons as well. Experience with this new-pattern army has led to ideas like lighter machine guns, trench mortars, and rifle grenades, which all seem quite useful, so long as we can get the right people on designing them and manufacturing them."

 ww1_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Effort III"
 ww1_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The Quartermasters have sent a letter of demands for more rifles equipped for the conditions of trenches- those able to launch rifle grenades, attach bayonets or scopes, and more carbines. Though we could simply produce more straight up, it seems like a logical move is to bring our rifles to the standard of being able to do all of these things- which means a new, improved design."

 ww1_equipment_effort_4:0 "Equipment Effort IV"
 ww1_equipment_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Quartermasters have, unfortunately, sent us yet another list of demands. Luckily, we have instructed our postmasters to ignore any further mail from them. Their last demand is new equipment for our Engineer corps- Carbines, tools, and those new Flamethrowers, which will be commissioned as soon as possible. Of course, expanding the Engineer corps as such could provide for some unseen benefits..."

 ww1_armor_effort_1:0 "Armor Effort"
 ww1_armor_effort_1_desc:0 "Our prior investments have paid off! Artillery designers, Engineers, and vehicle designers have proposed to us a brand new type of vehicle- a heavily armored tractor with a direct fire gun. Though early designs are clearly not battle ready, this concept has strong promise- particularly in the field of ending the Trench stalemate in our favor, if these landships can stand up to machine gun fire, as is claimed."

 ww1_armor_effort_2:0 "Armor Effort II"
 ww1_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "Our experiments with armor have been a rousing success! However, we cannot be complacent with our current designs. Engineers have been proposing interesting concepts like rotating gun turrets, specific engine compartments, and a hatch for use by a commander, which cannot be ignored. If we are to be the first to make these ideas a reality, perhaps we could become unstoppable!"

 ww1_gasmask_focus:0 "Chemical Warfare Focus"
 ww1_gasmask_focus_desc:0 "Some of our chemists have proposed the use of a new, incredibly deadly agent- poisonous gas, delivered by our artillery and trench mortars. Though chemical warfare has been frowned on for roughly a century, what choice do we have if we are to win the war? Beyond investing in these, it's also likely for the best to develop countermeasures quickly- it would be unfortunate for such an advancement to turn on us!"

 ww1_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The value of the Fighter is unquestionable. If we focus our aviation efforts on the design and use of these aircraft, our nation's planes may one day flood the sky, destroying all enemy planes that even try to oppose them, which could provide a major advantage. Of course, the Bomber lobby has interesting proposals as well, so perhaps we should not put all of our eggs into one basket..."

 ww1_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus" #link me pls
 ww1_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Bomber is a simple, practical machine. Focusing our production and designers on this specific class of aircraft would be a good way to ensure that we can use the Air Force as a ground support tool, able to help the infantry gain ground by destroying enemy defenses and positions. Of course, fighters should still be produced, but these bombers may win us the war."

 ww1_airship_focus:0 "Airship Focus"
 ww1_airship_focus_desc:0 "The Balloon is our oldest aircraft, and experts are predicting that it may not have a long future on the battlefield. This is no excuse to ignore the designs of such craft, especially when they may still be an effective way to deliver large bomb payloads. By bringing out-of-work Zeppelin manufacturers under the state's wing, we could squeeze the most out of this design while we still can."

 ww1_aviation_effort_1:0 "Aviation Effort I" #Link me pls
 ww1_aviation_effort_1_desc: "Now that we have formally established an Air Force, we have made some interesting advances. Most notably, our aircraft designers have been proposing designs for specific roles, rather than simply arming generic models. Getting effective use out of these planes, designed with roles like attacking enemy aircraft or dropping bombs in mind, will require testing and research, but may prove beneficial."

 ww1_aviation_effort_2:0 "Aviation Effort II"
 ww1_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Our efforts to create aircraft roles have resulted in a variety of vastly different aircraft, which do vastly different things. The Fighter class of aircraft in particular has attracted a great amount of youth to aircraft, some of whom are quite adept already, who have some interesting ideas for the future of our air force. Perhaps we should gather some of their ideas, for the good of our doctrines."

 ww1_aviation_effort_3:0 "Aviation Effort III"
 ww1_aviation_effort_3_desc:0 "The development of the Synchronised MG has changed the rules of the Aircraft game. Fighters are now far more effective, Zeppelins might be seeing their last flights, and we need innovative thinkers to help keep us on pace with this development. If we become the master of this weapon, which will perhaps change the air war as much as ground war, we will be well on our way to Air Superiority."

 ww1_aviation_effort_4:0 "Aviation Effort IV"
 ww1_aviation_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Air Force, which was established only recently, has now integrated itself completely into our armed forces. This brings us the obvious benefit of a pool of aviation experts, as well as a new class of ''Ace'' pilots, who are even becoming minor celebrities. Hiring on these people certainly can't hurt us, and will lead to nice developments in our field."

 ww1_aviation_effort_5_desc:0 "With the development of brand new types of aircraft, such as the Tactical and Strategic Bomber, we have yet more testing and theorycrafting to do on exactly the best way to get use out of this influx of new models. Some are already speculating that bombers may be a wonder weapon capable of deciding a war. What poppycock!"

 ww1_pilotformation_1:0 "Pilot Formation I"
 ww1_pilotformation_1_desc:0 "Currently, Aircraft fly solo- distant from each other, and engaging in one-on-one duels with any enemies they might encounter. However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."

 ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "Pilot Formation II"
 ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

 ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "Aircraft Production"
 ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us loyally, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. Who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."

 ww1_aircraftprod_2:0 "Aircraft Production II"
 ww1_aircraftprod_2_desc:0 "While Aircraft have been produced at factories dedicated to vehicle production, specific manufacturies dedicated specifically to planes themselves have been established. Usually commandeered by experts, these new industries will most certainly help us in coming up with new designs, and streamlining those existing."

 ww1_airbomb_1:0 "Air Bombing Effort"
 ww1_airbomb_1_desc:0 "While the tactics of our fighters are improving with formations, our bombers are still very basic machines with very basic doctrines. Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."

 ww1_airbomb_2:0 "Air Bombing Effort II"
 ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues with our air force currently is the fact that bombing is, for the most part, a guessing game, with the required geometrical calculations simply not viable methods mid-flight. With not just doctrine, but also standardized equipment and training for its use, we can turn bombing from a mildly threatening game of chance to a precise and deadly science."

 ww1_air_innovation:0 "Air Innovation Focus"
 ww1_air_innovation_desc:0 "All of the recent developments to air warfare, both in theory and in practice, have given birth to a golden age of aircraft development. From pilots down to the plane mechanics, it seems that everyone has something to improve and potentially offer, which we can use on a national level. Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not."

 ww1_navalair:0 "Naval Bombing Effort"
 ww1_navalair_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret. A seaplane was launched from a static ship, dropped a bomb onto one of our old scrappers, sinking the poor old vessel. Though most of our high command was unimpressed, attention from the head of state could certainly give this ambition a boost."

Huge ships with equally large guns fighting at incredible engagement ranges is slated to be the order of the day. Due to this, a modernization program for our ships, as well as training in the new ways of warfare for our officers, is most certainly in order."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_1:0 "Naval Gun Effort"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_1_desc:0 "While our ship designs themselves are constantly evolving, we cannot forget about the guns aboard our vessels. Though we've been standardizing calibers for over a century now, we still have far too many different variable gun sizes for far too many roles. By cutting the total amount of standards, and making each type of gun more general-purpose, we can streamline ship design."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_2:0 "Naval Gun Effort II"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_2_desc:0 "Though we have now solved the problems of the guns themselves, we must also stay up to date with equipment that supports our naval batteries. Rangefinders are starting to become a common feature of our ships, and ensuring that our officers know how to use it, especially compared to our guns' maximum effective range, will make battling a much smoother process, and help us get more use out of our newer, better guns."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_3:0 "Naval Gun Effort III"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_3_desc:0 "Analogue Fire Control is making a splash in the naval community, for its ability to guide all guns of a ship onto the same rough target.

 ww1_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Navy"
 ww1_flexible_navy_desc:0 "A great mass of ships is of no use to us if they're only patrolling a very small amount of the ocean. Building a fleet which can go anywhere, any time it's needed, with large amounts of screens supported by decent numbers of Battleships and Dreadnoughts, could help us control more of the sea and respond to a larger variety of threats, allowing us to project power all across the world."

 ww1_large_navy:0 "Large Navy"
 ww1_large_navy_desc:0 "Having just Battleships and Dreadnoughts would be formidible on its own, but also creating a solid core of screens and battlecruisers can easily tip the seas in our favor from both the tactical options such crafts give us, as well as sheer number. If we build around this concept and study the doctrine to match, our fleet may just become unbeatable."

 ww1_navyreform:0 "Navy Deployment"

Serbia had promised the support for Essad Toptani, as well as financing his militia, at least until Albania is pacified and fully under his control. However, domestic analysts consider this as move of betrayal, as Serbia is still in most of Albania's eyes, considered an arch enemy, and even more moderate of them see this move as an attempt at occupation.

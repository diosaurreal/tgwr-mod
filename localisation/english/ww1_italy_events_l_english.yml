ww1_italy.11.t: "A Second Scramble"
ww1_italy.11.d: "The French intervention in Morroco has legitimized our interests in Libya, but is also causing panic in our government. It seems a second scramble has reached Africa, with the French gob..."
ww1_italy.27.a: "They will always find something to complain about!"
ww1_italy.28.t: "Revolutionary Mood Sweeps the Left"
ww1_italy.28.d: "The Italian left has always had its reformist and revolutionary wings, but the revolutionary wing was always the smaller of the two. Unfortunately, the left has starting becoming more and more radical as of late. They see compromise with liberals as becoming increasingly impossible, and are beginning to favor strikes as a way to bring change instead of bringing change through the ballot box."
ww1_italy.30.a: "What are they so mad about? It's true"
ww1_italy.30.b: "I suppose better language could have been used"
ww1_italy.40.t: "Not 'Liberators' After all..."
ww1_italy.45.t: "Cold, Calculated Realism"
ww1_italy.46.t: "Mantaining a Friendly Socialist Party"
ww1_italy.46.d: "The PSI has, for the past 3 Giolitti cabinets, elected to not stand in strong opposition to Giolitti and his cabinet. It seems they have voted to do the same this time around. The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There are leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists take over the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their Withdrawal from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."
ww1_italy.46.a: "Let's hope they stick to their senses, then."
ww1_italy.47.a: "He's lead 3 cabinets already for a reason, after all."
ww1_italy.48.t: "Formation of Catholic-Liberal Coalitions on the Province Level"
ww1_italy.48.d: "Giolitti has been considering a alliance with the Catholic Electoral Union, a powerful force that mobilizes Catholics to vote for their favored canidates. It seems a liberal-catholic alliance is not crazy at all, at least not as crazy as you would think it to be 10 years ago, as alliances between catholics and liberals have been popping up in at the local level in Turin, Florence, and Venice. They ally together in part because of fear from socialists and ultra nationalists. With this, Giolitti has been looking at somehow expanding these local alliances at the national level."
ww1_italy.48.a: "It would be an unstoppable alliance!"
ww1_italy.50.t: ""It Was our War, Actually.""
ww1_italy.50.d: "...At least that's what the nationalists are claiming, in regards to the Libyan war."
ww1_italy.86.a: "We are anxious for a response"
ww1_italy.87.t: "Italian Interests in joining the Entente"
ww1_italy.87.d: "Sir Edward Grey comes with reports from an Italian ambassador. Italy is interested in joining the Entente and even has outlines some basic territorical ambotions, such as Trentinto and territories along the Adriadiac.The Italian politician who initiated this, Sonnino has urged that the negotiations take place in London, rather than Rome, to ensure that they're concealed from Germany and Austria-Hungary."
ww1_italy.87.a: "Let's Ask France & Russia"
ww1_italy.88.t: "Italy in the Entente?"
ww1_italy.88.d: "Italian Politicians has reached out to Britain claiming that they have an interest in joining the Entente in return for Trentito and Adriatic territories. Before we can make anymore advancments, Britain is ensuring our approval or denial of Italy joining the Entente."
ww1_italy.106.a: "What?!"
ww1_italy.106.b: "Accident! It was an accident!"
ww1_italy.106.c: "Ok"
ww1_italy.107.t: "Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf calls for war with the Italians"
ww1_italy.107.d: "Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, who is an anti-Italian, calls for war after the incident in the Adriatic, justifying that it would be suicidal not to use the opportunity to crush the Italians"
ww1_italy.107.a: "Nonsense, this was clearly an accident!"
ww1_italy.109.t: "Muslims Boycott Italian Goods!"
ww1_italy.109.d: "Muslims around the world in areas like in the British Raj and Africa, are boycotting Italian products and goods in order to pressure our government to stop our conquest of Libya. They vow that all muslims, according to the Qur'an, are all brethren, and that therefore, all Muslims should unite to help the Ottoman Empire in every possible way, including a boycott of Italian products"
ww1_italy.109.a: "Better wrap up quickly"
ww1_italy.111.t: "Italian Conquest of the Dodecanese"
ww1_italy.111.d: "The Italians have successfully captured the Ottoman-owned islands of the Dodecanese. The Italian government hopes this finally pressures [TUR.GetName] into signing a peace deal in their favor. This is an event that could change the tides of this war, as the Italians are now stationned with an army less than 50 kilometers away from Mainland Anatolia."
ww1_italy.111.a: "Surprising"
ww1_italy.111.b: "They're in our backyard"
ww1_italy.111.c: "This must be the final blow!"
ww1_italy.112.t: "Italian Conquest of Rhodes"
ww1_italy.112.d: "The Italians have successfully conducted a naval invasion of Rhodes today. The Italian government hopes this finally pressures [TUR.GetName] to sign a favorable peace agreement as the Italian army has secured an island nearby Anatolia."
ww1_italy.112.a: "Wow"
ww1_italy.112.b: "How could this happen?"
ww1_italy.112.c: "It's too easy"
ww1_italy.114.t: "Confindustria Is Supporting Opposition Parties"
ww1_italy.114.d: "We've discovered that Confindustria is 100% involving themselves in Italian politics. They've been donating to and offering support ot, quite openly, right leaning canidates in preperations for Italy's elections."
ww1_italy.147.t: "Womens Suffrage Achieved in Italy"
ww1_italy.147.d: "In a move mirroring the Representation of the People Act in Britain, Italy's conservatives have worked with socialists to outflank liberals from the left, and pass an ammendment to a recent male suffrage bill expanding suffrage to women. With only Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Australia currently having women able to vote, this is historic move and might represent increased momentum for womens suffrage movements world wide. Already, women in America in particular are intensifying their fight for womens suffrage, with protests being organized in France as well."
ww1_italy.147.a: "Quite the monumental feat"
ww1_italy.179.t: "Question of Religion in Libya"

ww1_italy.184.t: "The Franco-British Threat"
ww1_italy.184.d: "The French have recently ratified a naval treaty with the British, to the great dismay of our government. With Britain and France increasingly becoming close, a war between the central powers and a British backed Entente would surely see the Italian-German-Austrian navies be crushed. This hypothetical has lead to many in the navy to call for an increase in funding, to ensure we could combat any of our potential enemies navies, whether it be French, British, or even Austrian."
ww1_italy.184.a: "They have a convincing argument"
ww1_italy.184.b: "Our current naval funding is sufficient."
ww1_italy.189.h: "Let's settle colonial disbutes on the Libyan border"
ww1_italy.198.t: "Britain Agrees to Lower Tariffs"
ww1_italy.198.d: "Word from London is that the British have agreed to reduce the tariffs they have levied on non-colonial subjects of theirs used to encourage inter empire trade, on the condition that we reduce tariffs on their exports as well. With this, we can expect a increase in trade between us and the British, with great profits to follow."
ww1_italy.198.a: "Great"
ww1_italy.199.t: "Britain Refuses Tariff Reductions"
ww1_italy.199.d: "Stating that they 'cannot make such special exceptions' for us revolving any trade deals, the British have shot down our hope for a trade deal. This has certainly reduced goodwill between Italy and Britain, but talks must continue for now."
ww1_italy.199.a: "Ugh. Whatever"
ww1_italy.203.b: "That's off-limits, sorry."
ww1_italy.204.t: "Britain Agrees to our Demands for an Expanded Istria"
ww1_italy.204.d: "Although hesitant, the British have agreed to our request for the boundries of Istria to be pushed eastward. This has angered Serbia and Russia, but alas they will soon be ours."

ww1_italy.205.t: "Britain Refuses to Expand Istrian Borders Eastward"
ww1_italy.205.d: "The Brits have informed us that as they promised Fiume to Serbia, they cannot accept our demand for the borders of Istria to be pushed eastward.

ww1_italy.205.a: "Regrett..."
ww1_italy.217.t: "Britain Agrees to Grant Ownership of Dalmatia"
ww1_italy.217.d: "Our friends in London have informed us that they have no objections to our ownership of Dalmatia after the war. We can now move on to other matters."
ww1_italy.217.a: "A notable concession from them!"
ww1_italy.218.t: "Britain Refuses to Promise us Dalmatia"
ww1_italy.218.d: "Britain has informed us that they promised to give Dalmatia to Serbia after the war ends and thus we cannot expect it if we join their side. Dalmatia is a key portion of our demands, although if they sweeten the pot in other areas we may be able to forgive them."
ww1_italy.218.a: "Its... fine"

ww1_italy.251.t: "Coal Shortages"
ww1_italy.251.d: "The collapse of trade caused by being at war with half of Europe's great powers and the increased demand for coal to fuel our machines of war have caused a shortage of coal across the country. Civilian industries are struggling, and in the winter people will be at risk of freezing."
ww1_italy.251.a: "We'll tackle this issue"
ww1_italy.253.t: "Implementing Price, Wage, and Rent Controls"
ww1_italy.253.d: "do later"
ww1_italy.253.a: "This will help"
ww1_italy.254.t: "Inflation Creeps Upwards"
ww1_italy.254.d: "With our increased spending on the war, inflation..."
ww1_italy.258.t: "Labor Relations Remain Tense"
ww1_italy.258.d: "Despite our efforts, relations between workers and employers have remained in the dumster fire. Strikes are common place, distrust is widespread, and socialism remains popular amongst the working class. The amount of strikes is effecting our industrial base, slowing down our already pitiful industrial output."
ww1_italy.258.a: "Well, Rome wasn't built in a day"
ww1_italy.259.t: "Poor Harvest Down South"
ww1_italy.259.d: "With winter ending and the weather warming up, Italian farmers down south have been met with devastating returns. With unlucky conditions, many farmers have produced significantly less then usual. It's already putting us at risk of a crisis, farmers are risking going bankrupt and food prices are expected to soar."
ww1_italy.259.a: "Why has mother nature cursed us?"
ww1_italy.284.a: "This war needs to hurry up and end!"
ww1_italy.285.t: "German Submarines raid the British Channel"
ww1_italy.285.d: "Our imports from the United Kingdom are seeing huge delays as British shipping attempts to dodge German submarines sinking anything leaving the mainland. Supply chains are starting to back up due to delays, and prices are rising."
ww1_italy.285.a: "Why can't Germany just make exceptions?"
ww1_italy.299.t: "Pollio Dies"
ww1_italy.299.d: "Alberto Pollio, an Italian army officer and leading voice in military reforms since 1908, has passed away today due to ramping heart problems regarding the myocardium. With his passing, a large hole in military leadership has opened."
ww1_italy.302.t: "Riots in the South"
ww1_italy.302.d: "The war and it's effect on our supply of food is taking its tool on struggling farmers down south. Italian farmers who were already struggling in the light of the poor harvest last year are now being stretched even thinner with the new laws that prioritize food to the army, leaving them with little to eat themselves. Many in the south are resorting to rioting, with demands that we help alleviate their suffering."
ww1_italy.302.b: "The war is hard for all of us"
ww1_italy.303.t: "Italian Republican Party Endorses Intervention"
ww1_italy.303.d: "Italy's Republican party lead by Colajanni has launched a press campaign lobbying for intervention on the side of France. The Republicans have defended nationalism for their justification for war with the Central Powers, claiming Italy has a duty to liberate Italians in Tyrol and Triest. Although the PSI and the Republican Party have had close relations in the past, their differing stances on the Great War have caused tensions to rise significantly between the two."
ww1_italy.303.a: "Quite suprising from an estremo party"
ww1_italy.304.t: "Italy Demands Annexation"
ww1_italy.304.d: "[ITA.GetLeader]'s diplomats approached us today saying we will be integrated in the colony of Italian Somaliland. We, of course, has no choice to accept, and to bend to Italy's demands."
ww1_italy.304.a: "Why are you playing this nation?"
ww1_italy.304.b: "We must resist!"
ww1_italy.307.t: "Question of Farmer Loans"
ww1_italy.307.d: "Italy currently has a quite high level of financial aid going to it's farmers down south, a level that some are saying may be too high. With our government attempting to save money, there's some calls to cut back on the aid given to farmers. This, of course, would harm some southern farmers, but with the increased demand for their products, some believe they won't go backrupt. What should we do?"
ww1_italy.307.a: "Why would we cut back on their aid in a time where we need their food the most?"
ww1_italy.307.b: "We will cut back on their aid, we need the money"
ww1_italy.308.t: "Austrians Enter our Territory!"
ww1_italy.308.d: "A disaster has struck Italy: the Austrian enemy has offically gained a foothold in the country. Far from the propaganda that we gave our citizens and soldiers, the war has rapidly turned against our favor. Our allies are furious at our incompentence, and our population is left fearful."
ww1_italy.308.a: "We'll kick them out soon enough"
ww1_italy.311.a: "Are you tired of winning yet?"
ww1_italy.312.t: "Italy Wishes to Renegotiate Tariffs"
ww1_italy.312.d: "Since the late 1800's Italy has leveraged very high tariffs on our (and the world's) goods. This was mainly to strengthen Italy's domestic industry, and while it has protected local manufacturers in Italy, it's led to unusually expensive goods in Italian markets and a devastated south. Seeing that their tariff strategy is no longer working, they've reached out to us for talks. In response to Italy's tariffs on our goods, we've placed our own very high tariffs on Italian agricultural products, which has devastated their farmer's exports. They wish to seek an agreement that if we lower tariffs..."
ww1_italy.315.t: "Giolitti on the Libyan Crisis"
ww1_italy.315.d: "Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Italy have began to break down lately, with Austrian mediations all failing. Nationalists have hijacked the media to rally the public behind a war, and some sort of confrontation with Turkey seems inevitable. The situation does not excite Prime Minister Giolitti at all, however. In his private speeches with parliament and military seniors, he's described his fears. As he put it himself, "The integrity of what remains of the Ottoman Empire is one of the principles upon which the world's balance of power is based. Therefore, I reject the idea that it is in our national interest to shatter one of the cornerstones of the international order. What if, after we have attacked Libya and destabilized the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans begin to stir? And what if a Balkan war provokes a clash between the two power blocs and a European war? Italy must not be the country that bears the responsibility of putting a match to the powder keg.""
ww1_italy.315.a: "You're gambling with a world war!"
ww1_italy.327.t: "Turati Struggles To Enforce Socialist Unity"
ww1_italy.327.d: "Despite the offical PSI position of being in support of Giolitti, Turati is starting to struggle to enforce party unity on key votes. Radicals such as Bentito Mussolini have been rallying the maximalist wing of the PSI into opposing Giolitti, and they're starting to peel away votes."
ww1_italy.327.a: "He needs to pull himself together!"
ww1_italy.330.t: "Socialists protest Catholic Education"
ww1_italy.330.d: "Many socialists were present in cities like Milano and Torino protesting the catholic takeover of Education, as they believe their children shouldn't be learning religious theocracy."
ww1_italy.330.a: "Let them riot, and rot."
ww1_italy.332.t: "Protests Due To The Price Of Milk"
ww1_italy.332.d: "The government currently has a set floor for milk prices to try and avoid huge shortages, and our set prices are being seen as much too high by Italian citizens. Italians, especially mothers, have taken to the streets to demand lower prices for milk, with some resorting to stealing milk."
ww1_italy.332.a: "We'll lower the price by 25%"
ww1_italy.332.b: "They need to sit down and shut up"
ww1_italy.335.t: "Earthquake in Sicily"
ww1_italy.335.d1: "When Sicily was still recovering from the devastating Messina earthquake of 1908, another earthquake, this time of 4.9 magnitude, has shook the region, causing severe damage to structures and human lives."
ww1_italy.335.d2: "Just after Sicily recovered from the..."
ww1_italy.336.a: "Let's get to work"
ww1_italy.345.t: "The Democratic Socialist"
ww1_italy.345.d: "Running a fairly leftist administartion, certainly the most leftist one Italy has seen in it's modern history, the question of Giolitti's sucessor interested many conservatives, who believed it was their turn to return to power. Unfortunately for them, Giolitti has worked to undermine them, favoring a leftist sucessor instead. Suprising many, Giolitti has met with the king to help propel a PSI member into power as his sucessor. Bonomi, he believes, would ensure that the PSI continues its moderation as it focuses on dealing with its maximist wing. An accomplishment that would greatly stabilize Italian politics."

ww1_italy.347.t: "Riots Up North"
ww1_italy.347.d: "Our attempts to split the socialist movement not gone unnoticed by socialist organizations up north. While bitterly divided, socialist groups up north of all kinds have began to unite against our attepts to weaken socialist movements in Italy. Anarchists, maximalists, and reformists are all engaging in protests up north with varying levels of violence being reported."
ww1_italy.347.a: "Bastards"
ww1_italy.348.t: "Murder Of Pacifist Protesters Sparks Outrage"
ww1_italy.348.d: "Rioting up north has escalated severly as a few Italian officers clashing with a few pacifist socialist protesters resulted in 3 protesters dying. Our government has claimed that the protesters provoked the situation while the socialists claim that we are unleashing a brutal crackdown on Italians freedoms. The men have became martyrs for socialists up north, with socialist organizations across the country offically declaring themselves on strike."
ww1_italy.348.a: "This will blow over"
ww1_italy.349.t: "Independent Communes Declared Across Italy"
ww1_italy.349.d: "Strikes up north have turned revolutionary as nearly a hundred towns up north have offically proclaimed themself as independent communes, with some workers attempting to arm themself. While in reality their little rebellion can hardly be called a civil war, the situation looks like it may be heading that way."
ww1_italy.349.a: "We need to formulate a response!"
ww1_italy.350.t: "Mobilizing The Army?"
ww1_italy.350.d: "Some government officals, worried by the situation up north, have called for us to mobilize the army to put down the rebels up north. They claim it would scare off most protesters and leave the remaining violent rioters vulernable. There are some others in the government who claim this may be too inflamitory however."
ww1_italy.350.a: "Mobilize the army, but have them respond only if provoked"
ww1_italy.350.b: "Mobilizing the army is a step too far, the police can handle it."
ww1_italy.350.c: "Mobilize the army and send them to crush the rioters"
ww1_italy.351.t: "Contacting The CGL?"
ww1_italy.351.d: "The Italian general confederation of labour has no love for our government, but they are also much more moderate compared to many anarchist groups actively trying to overthrow the government up north. If we try and contact them, we may be able to convince them to try call for the anarchists to stand down."
ww1_italy.351.a: "Let's contact them"
ww1_italy.351.b: "They're traitors, too. Ignore them."
ww1_italy.352.t: "Red Week Sucessfully Supressed"
ww1_italy.352.d: "With our consistent response to red week, the rioting and anarchism up north has quickly lost steam. Most protesters up north have gone home, while our response forces have been able to arrest those who attempted to form their own independent communes. Of course, the north is far from stable, but we can now say it's no longer actively rioting against the government."
ww1_italy.352.a: "A close one!"
ww1_italy.353.t: "CGL Endorses The Commune Movement"
ww1_italy.353.d: "Our attempts to reach out to the CGL have completely failed. Our aggressive response to protesters and brutal crackdown by the military has severly alienated their leaders, who now see the rioting anarchists as preferable to our current government. They've outright endorsed overthrowing the government in all but name, and with our leaders wasting time not cracking down on them earlier, they're in a strong position. We may be at risk of a real civil war soon."
ww1_italy.353.a: "We'll have them hanged for this!"
ww1_italy.354.t: "Situation Continues to Esculate With No Government Response"
ww1_italy.354.d: "Our governent has currently done nothing to respond to the active insurection up north. We've refused to send in any army units, and the small police forces up north are completely overrun. With no attempts to open dialogue with top socialist movements, the situation up north is rapidly deteriorating. The very unorganized and chaotic communes that have been declared up north have began to truly organize themselve. It's now clear that we're going to have to put these anarchists down, and it's going to be bloody."
ww1_italy.354.a: "They will learn their lesson!"
ww1_italy.359.t: "Right Attempts to Bring Government Down"
ww1_italy.359.d: "The right wing block of Italian politics has made it no secret their despisal for Bonomi's government. With Bonomi propping up unions, the right, no doubt funded by confindustria, is intensifying their attacks on Bonomi. Parliamentry members are making long speeches in parliament raving against our government, attempting to get the king to dismiss us. While so far we're ok, the ramped up attacks are polarizing Italy's parliament."
ww1_italy.359.a: "Just a bunch of performative bastards"
ww1_italy.360.t: "Riots in the South"
ww1_italy.360.d: "Our nationalizing of education has lead to severe backlash in the south. Southern catholics are claiming our government is attempting to remove their religious freedom and destroy the moral fabric of Italy. They've taken to the streets, rioting and even clashing with local education authorities in limited cases."
ww1_italy.360.a: "They're so brainwashed it's sickening"
ww1_italy.361.t: "Right Appeals to the King"
ww1_italy.361.d: "With riots in the south, members of the religious right have met with the king and requested he dismiss the current socialist government, claiming the government is destabilizing the country and removing religious freedoms of Italians. Emmanuel has resisted the many calls so far, but seeing the riots in the south, he is starting to buy into the arguments that Bonomi's government is simply bringing too much change too quickly. What if his reforms push Italy into a civil war?"
ww1_italy.361.a: "These fears are way over exaggerated"
ww1_italy.361.b: "It's true, Bonomi is destabilizing Italy. Giolitti should form a new government"
ww1_italy.365.t: "Our stance on the Italo-Ottoman situation"
ww1_italy.365.d: "A couple of days ago, the Ottomans have recieved a declaration of war from Rome and has been at war with our neighbor ever since. It is time for us to enter the situation and deescalate the situation, as both fighting powers can be considered our allies."

ww1_italy.366.t: "The Italians ask for support"

ww1_italy.369.t: "Fate of the PSI"
ww1_italy.369.d: "Recent events have made it clear that the PSI is no regular political party, its a subversive element attempting to destroy the state and the Kingdom itself. We need to fight back against them, though the way to fight back could very dramatically depending on our goals. There is a large plurality of socialists who do accept the monarchy and who oppose violent activites of the maximalist wing of the PSI, and maybe they should have their place in Italian politics. What should the fate of the PSI be?"
ww1_italy.369.a: "Let's simply target the maximalists and anarchists"

ww1_italy.376.t: "Home Front Deteriorating"
ww1_italy.376.d: "With the war entering its second year, situations on the homefront are continuing to worse for Italians. Inflation is at all time highs, bread is unaffordable, and Italians simply aren't feeling patriotic. As the war continues, the demands for food for our soldiers are increasing, the deficit continues to be out of control, and people are being streched thin."
ww1_italy.376.a: "Just give us a few months!"
ww1_italy.377.t: "PSI Winning the Propaganda War"
ww1_italy.377.d: "Although our government is attempting to spread nationalist propaganda and revigorate patriotism amongst Italians, it's not working. As the domestic front continues to worse, Italians are turning to the PSI who claims they would immediantly pull out of the war and help solve the domestic issues at home. As the popularity of the PSI grows, so does the revolutionary wing, who is threatening a revolution soon."
ww1_italy.377.a: "Not good!"
ww1_italy.378.t: "Rationing Programs Slowing Down"
ww1_italy.378.d: "As the situation at home continues to worse, rationing programs at home are running into shortages. As many predicted, we only had enough food reserves to last around 2 years, and as we cross that time period, our stockpiled grains and cereals are running out. Combined with continued poor harvests, food shortages are worsening."

ww1_italy.382.d: "As a result of efforts from the industrial mobilization committe, workers in key industries for production of weapons have seen their numbers double, soaring as the prospects of high wages attracts many. Although our propaganda campaigns to encourage work in industries due to a patriotic fever aren't as sucessful, as long as we mantain high pay, we can expect workers in these industries to cotinue to climb."

ww1_iw_br_italy.23.d: "The rapid dissolution of the Austrian empire has came to a suprise to much of the Entente. The general plan post war was that an Austro-Hungarian state would exist, grant concessions to entente neighbors, and would become a secondary power in Europe. With the empire collapsing into various new ethnic states, the entente has had to formulate a quick reaction. To secure stability in the adriatic coast, a coalition of the willing has been assembled to occupy costal cities and prevent the outbreak of ethnic violence. This occupation is expected to be temporary as the Entente decides the future of who will own what on the adriatic coast, especially as tensions between Italy and Serbia ramp up over their differing vision on the future of the balkans."

We are going to abolish this, obviously, but there is a question on what the line should be replaced with.

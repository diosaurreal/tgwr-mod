INS_ethical_policy: "Ethische Politiek"
INS_ethical_policy_desc: "Instead of oppressive and violent rule, the Dutch implemented a policy of appeasement by developing infrastructure in irrigation, health, transport, logistics and administration. The policy also encouraged immigration from Europe and migration to unexplored lands. However, all these benefits have not been shared by all social classes, but only by a few upper classes."

BOS_POWDERKEG_DESC: "During Congress of Berlin in 1878 Austria-Hungary was allowed to occupy Bosnia Vilayet, but officially remained part of Ottoman Empire. In 1908, Austria-Hungary officially annexed area establishing what is today known as Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, area jointly ruled by Cisleithania and Transleithania.\n\nEver since 1878 occupation, these lands were treated as a far away colony. These lands are inhabitated by three groupations of which none forms a majority; Croats, Serbs and Bosniak Muslims. Each of these groups have different political ideas for future course of the land they share and they are not good with compromises..."

BOS_first_diet_elections: "Opening of the Diet"
BOS_first_diet_elections_desc: "Established in February 1910, the Landtag von Bosnien und der Herzegovina, or Bosansko-hercegovački sabor in Serbo-Croat, is a representative assembly over the Bosnian Condominium. Elections are planned to be held in May. Vote distribution among each religious group will be distributed along population census that was run last year, so there should not be much surprises, but seeing which parties will lead each ethnic group."

BOS_croat_ambitions: "The Croatian Parties"
#BOS_budget_1910: "1910 Budget"
#BOS_budget_1910_desc: "1910 Budget is about to be proposed to the newly elected Diet. Vienna tried its best to offer a decent budget that would start of first diet session as peacefully as possible. The 20 unelected members of the Diet already pledged support for its passage, so we should not worry too much yet. We are yet to see who are we dealing with."
BOS_sno_ambitions_desc: "Largest ethnic group in Bosnia and Herzegovina saw enviable results in elections. Every seat possible was won by now largest faction in Bosnian Diet, totaling 31 seats. Serbs are by far most unruly nationality in condominium toward Vienna, so we fear how will we work with such a large unified block, which claims to be in opposition before they've even entered the session."
BOS_mpo_ambitions_desc: "MNO achieved impressive victory over Muslim Independent Party in this election winning all allocated seats for Muslims. Most of the party leadership and elected figures are beys and wealthy Muslim landowners, but that did not matter to the folk. Possible reasoning for such a landslide might be well-known MNO's newspaper 'Musavat' printed in Cyrillic and Latin scripts. Party at first glance seems neutral towards Vienna, which might become an issue if we do not address it in time."
BOS_croat_ambitions_desc: "After these elections Croatians were only nationality that didn't end up with an unified party leading all of their seats. Split of the vote happened because HNZ had a quarrel with archbishop Juraj Štadler over embracing Catholicism as a party value. HNZ neglected the demands saying that all Croats of all faiths are allowed to join and partake in party's activities. Štadler discontent with the response, created himself HKU, party that would represent similarly conservative values, but with more focus on faith. Although vote seems to be split, for now we do not see any deep divides."

BOS_if_bill_passes: "If the bill §Gpasses§! in the §YBosnian Diet§!:\n"
BOS_road_construction_bill: "The Road Construction Bill"
BOS_road_construction_bill_desc: "This Road Construction Bill presented to us by Bilinski is a major road building investment program. From diet is demanded absolute support. This bill, although being comprehensive and great improvement for infrastructure, comes with a likely unacceptable demand. In the bill, it states that language used on signs and in railways, is to be German and Hungarian only! We are yet to see consequences of such demand."
second_diet_session_ends: "The Second §YBosnian Diet Session§! ends"
third_diet_session_ends: "The Third §YBosnian Diet Session§! ends"
BOS_compulsory_education_law: "Compulsory Education Bill"
BOS_compulsory_education_law_desc: "Literacy rate in this area is equivalent of the rates in other powers colonies. Near 88% our country is illiterate and unfit to change from rural, stagnant and backwards lifestyle. With this proposed law we are setting the cornerstone of all education, making existing education compulsory, at least for first four grades. It is not a forceful change, as it is thoughtful of diverse cultures in the area: females of muslim faith, disabled and few other exceptions are reasonably exempt from this law. Diet seemingly stands united over this issue, hopefully things will stay this way."
BOS_agrarian_question_law_1911: "Allow Conversion of Kmets"
BOS_agrarian_question_law_1911_desc: "In 1908, when Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, many were disheartened by lack of action on question of serfdom and redistribution of lands, aiming to replace feudal system. Some defend Vienna by saying that Vienna doesn't allow serfdom and it doesn't force that issue to maintain balance in the region. Others believe it's because Vienna couldn't care less about this land. What we know is that Diet will vote on proposed compromise law tackling the question soon enough."
#BOS_break_viennas_lumber_restrictions: "Forest Bills? (temp)"
#BOS_break_viennas_lumber_restrictions_desc: ""
BOS_purge_german_in_communication: "Purge German in Internal Communication"
BOS_purge_german_in_communication_desc: "One of concerns of many Muslims, Serbs and some Croats too is presence of German in practically all official internal communication. For a land that is not literate even in their own language, rule to use German for official practices is unreasonable. Diet is preparing to send a demand to Vienna about this issue."
BOS_postal_savings_bank: "Postal Savings Bank"
BOS_postal_savings_bank_desc: "Economy in this region is backwards and incompatible with Empire's, to the point that a proper bank indigenous to this area does not exist. Finance ministry is preparing a proposal for finally constructing one but under not so favourable terms, for ethnicies in condominium, which demand higher autonomy in condominium's economy. Negotiations will be certainly lengthy and this law might not go so smoothly as others before."
BOS_remove_hungarian_lang_from_railways: "Remove Hungarian from Railways"
BOS_remove_hungarian_lang_from_railways_desc: "Hungarian language, even more foreign to people of Bosnia and Herzegovina than poorly known German language, is used in railways equally as German. German some people know, but Hungarian none. For this proposal that is planned to be sent to Vienna every ethnic group in condominium stands for, with Croats being most avid supporters of this cause."
BOS_appease_croats: "Appease the Croat Catholics"
BOS_appease_croats_desc: "The Croatian members of our parliament are generally inclined to Vienna and accepting of laws proposed by Vienna. This loyalty needs to be praised and compensated for by shifting our interests slightly to their sides but definitely not entertaining their ideas of Trialism and similar nonsense."
BOS_appease_muslims: "Appease the Bosniak Muslims"
BOS_appease_muslims_desc: "The Bosniak Muslims, unlike Serbs and Croats in condominium are not a nationalistic groupation, but more of a chaotic set of pockets scattered around condominium where they form a plurality at best. As they are not expansionist, they're best choice to stand up for. This wouldn't be a change of course as Vienna has been pushing this idea for a long time."
BOS_cvijet_hrvatske: "A History Lesson"
BOS_cvijet_hrvatske_desc: "sidz note to self"
BOS_begin_second_session: "Begin Second Diet Session"
BOS_begin_second_session_desc: "First Diet session did not go so smoothly the way many hoped for. Many Laws have been passed, but troublesome road construction bill was too big of a pain to deal with, so much so it alone ended the session. Eventually bill will have to be passed, ideally soon as possible during this session."
BOS_dealing_with_protestors: "Response to Student-Police Clashes"
BOS_dealing_with_protestors_desc: "Everyone saw what happened in the streets of Sarajevo. Noone expected such a fierce stand from protestors for a cause that is not connected to their rights or duties. Such brave stance against questionable Hungarian closure of Croatian Sabor, yet has to be condemned as such protests threaten to shatter condominium's shaky stability. On the other hand, most of the seats in our Diet do not support actions of police during these events. No matter what, an official and careful response from Diet have to be sent to the public."
BOS_elect_council_boards: "Elect Council Boards"
BOS_elect_council_boards_desc: "sidz note to self" #dagg is it okay if i imagine fake shit
# oh my god please dont become like Leaf
BOS_send_memorandum: "Prepare Memorandum"
BOS_send_memorandum_desc: "New Finance Minister has been appointed. Diet is preparing to test the ground with a large-scale reformist memorandum, focused on increasal of Diet's powers, higher autonomy in condominium's economy and an complete overhaul of many aspects of Diet's work and elections. Memorandum will probably presented after further discussion on postponed inner party conference."
BOS_send_memorandum_tt: "§YPrepare Memorandum§!"
BOS_inner_party_conference: "Inner-party Conference"
BOS_inner_party_conference_desc: "A friendly inner party conference has been organized to discuss future laws while Diet is not really in session. Things need to be talked about and of course, memorandum signed and approved by as many as possible members of last session. Right after this conference it is planned to deliver memorandum to Bosnia's new governor general, Oskar Potiorek."
BOS_hospitals_smth: "Hospital Construction Bill"
BOS_hospitals_smth_desc: "State of the condominium begs for modernization in all possible ways. Healthcare is one of priorities that we need to be more attentive to. Such bill would come nicely, as passage of a universally accepted bill after so much infighting could smoothen some issues."
BOS_second_road_bill: "Second Road Bill"
BOS_second_road_bill_desc: "Bilinski started strong his tenure, maybe even too strong and harsh, many in the Diet would say. After rejecting memorandum proposed by Diet with threats, he has kept steady pace of forcing bills, issues and confronting opposition head to head. Serbian, mostly obstructionist side dislikes this change of leadership. But budget had to be passed and so does this incoming Road bill. It is a rework of an old one, one which tore apart first diet session..."
BOS_third_diet_session_focus: "Begin Third Diet Session"
BOS_third_diet_session_focus_desc: "Second Diet session divided brothers and sisters into cut-throat-like situations. Diet is in disarray and peace sounds unimaginable. Yet somehow here we are opening a session. Third session is opening out of necessity, mostly because of long-awaited budget passage, which only due to the fact that politicians are not even getting paid anymore. Diet is stuck between a rock and a hard place with a new-found truths: Allies are temporary and conflicts are unavoidable."
BOS_something_here: "Diet Resignation Law"
BOS_something_here_desc: "A proposal came recently for establishing rules about resignating as a member of the Diet. It is certainly not something of a high concern, but eventually needs to be tackled and talked about as currently rules are not that well defined."
BOS_partial_language_bill: "First Language Law"
BOS_partial_language_bill_desc: "The language issue that has been debated over since first session's early days is again on table. Concessions are maybe finally ready to be made and space for progress is visible. Is it finally time to get over this painful hardship?"
BOS_attract_austrian_investors: "Remaining Austrian Funds"
BOS_attract_austrian_investors_desc: "Of all funds given to Bosnian Diet, there is still some not yet spent money. This could be used for improving standards of living but for small things. Also Diet needs to seal the deal with Vienna and turn on forestry and mining a bit more profitable. Yeah, that's probably on what it's going to be spent."
BOS_language_law: "Law on Language of the Condominium"
BOS_language_law_desc: "Some progress was done according to some, on previous law connected to this language issue. Croat parties went into full obstructionism over the mere fact that state language would be Serbo-Croat instead of Croat. Yes, such a seemingly unimportant demand, supported by many Muslims too, is actually one of many sources of great divide between Croats and Serbs. Grudges have to be held off, for both are undoubtedly worse with having German or, God forgive me, Hungarian as an official language. Law proposes Serbo-Croat to become only recognized language in condominium, which won't be something Vienna would like to hear, but that shouldn't be of concern yet as passage of it in Diet is the current focus."
BOS_railway_bill: "Railway Bill"
BOS_railway_bill_desc: "Ever since Austrian overlords came to Bosnia and Herzegovina, some levels of infrastructure improvements were ongoing. Now it is time to finish big bulk of these projects with new Jajce-Srnetica line and additional funding to Sarajevo line to Slavonia."

BOS_closure_from_above: "Much Needed Punishment"
BOS_closure_from_above_desc: "Unruly Diet threatened Vienna with rejection of 1913 budget, in case of Vienna's rejection of Language Law proposal. To lightly put it, Vienna is furious with such actions, to the point that many rights of Diet will be restricted, possibly even closure of the session."
BOS_attempt_negotiations: "Mending Relations"
BOS_attempt_negotiations_desc: "Some say Vienna has been way too harsh with Diet, while others agree with taken actions. What is certain, is that budget has to be eventually passed and for that negotiations with obstructionist must begin."
BOS_SER_word_issue: "Radical's Media Fiasco"
BOS_SER_word_issue_desc: "Everyone is reading the news lately awaiting Potiorek's new dismissals and bans on whatever he (reasonably!) deems traitorous. Media has been hit the most, especially Serbian. Due to restrictions not moving any time soon, many members of SNO are talking about quitting their jobs in Diet to protest these so called 'totalitarian measures'. We are yet to see are these empty threats."
BOS_new_partial_elections: "Election for Empty Seats"
BOS_new_partial_elections_desc: "12 members of SNO party have left their seats empty in Diet! These groundbreaking news have to be met with new elections, at least partial for their seats. To ensure balance it will be only among Serbian voters, due to many complexities of Diet's elections system. SNO will most likely regain its lost seats, but not everyone is so certain about such opinion, because a new party has entered the ballot list, one that is more pro-Vienna and significantly more moderate. Still, we know nothing and can only hope for the best."
BOS_approach_new_party: "Flirt with Moderates"
BOS_approach_new_party_desc: "Partial elections have been surprise to everyone. There are already accusations of fraud and rigged elections, which have been proven not to be the case. New party, although being pro-Vienna, is not in any way connected to overlords. Truth is the police was everywhere during elections and they punished indicent behaviour, which might have angered or scared some of the supporters of the still bigger obstructionist SNO."


BOS_fourth_ses_begin: "Begin Fourth Diet Session"
BOS_fourth_ses_begin_desc: "Fourth session finally opens first meeting on stable ground. New party opened much wider posibilities of collaboration of all nationalities. With their vote, vote of most of appointed religious officials, Croats and few moderate Muslims, Diet has achieved stable majority, as all members of current coalition, except new party, have been involved in practically all laws yet passed. Let's get to business!"
BOS_land_redistribution: "Partial Land Redistribution"
BOS_land_redistribution_desc: "After lengthy talks with Muslims and softening their stances, finally it's time to address the land redistribution bill. When Austrians just came here in 1878, above 90% of land in Bosnia was Muslim owned, even tho they were not a majority or a plurality. Issue will finally be addresse, but naturally as a compromise."
BOS_some_investments: "some idiot invested haha" #this is pure imagination as it did not happen
BOS_postal_bank_runitlikeyouownit: "Indigenous and Free Bank Law"
BOS_postal_bank_runitlikeyouownit_desc: "Our long-awaited Postal Bank has finally been constructed after all this time of waiting! Now Diet is eager to demand as many as possible moderate reform to gain at least some reasonable levels of control of it's work. Noone is too optimistic as tensions in the Europe are increasing, what means that Austria might not like idea of more liberties for this Diet..."

BOS_investigate_tuzla_saltworks_desc: "Tuzla saltworks have been on a lease for more than a decade. Ancient salt mines in the area are a decent part of the local economy and Serb minority around the area is raising suspicions about firm breaking their promises in contract. Most of officials do not really care about such things so Diet is thinking about writing few letters to those involved and begin a minor investigation on its own."
BOS_vienna_restrict_lumber: "Demand Forestry Laws"
BOS_vienna_restrict_lumber_desc: "Bosnia's forests are a primordial and untapped source of income for Viennese pockets. Forest, almost untouched by Ottoman rule, is pristine and unique location for growth of lumber industry. Hungarian and Austrian companies are already scheming to profit out of it. This situation calls for immediate demand for protectionist laws so these industries don't abuse the area more than allowed. Serbs are demanding for such restrictions for years and will be certainly happy to hear such proposal."
BOS_crackdown_serb_media: "Silent Opposition's Voices"
BOS_crackdown_serb_media_desc: "Opposition has been real loud in all form of media ever since this darned conflict began in the region. To prevent any radicalization and other subversive measures propagated by Serbian demagogues, governor general Oskar Potiorek is planning to imposed bans, fines and arrests to force peace in already unstable condominium."
BOS_potiorek_panic: "Crush All Serb Media"
BOS_potiorek_panic_desc: "Not just that Balkan League emerged victorious, but they neglect peace treaty too!

Immediate closure of all Serb media is radical but effective measure, since liar greatest power is it's tongue."

German families, mostly from Silesia and the Rhineland, have started to settle Bosnia and created settlements such as Rudolfstal. German Protestants from Hungary also jumped on and created a settlement named Franzjosefsfeld. In 1890 a law was created to grant these families tax concessions and offered up to 12 hectares per family, rent-free for the first three years and a low mortgage which would only last 10 years if they adopted a Bosnian citizenship. Following this more Poles, Czechs and Ruthenians started to migrate.

# Events
ww1_bosnia.1.d: "Today is the day Bosnian Diet opened and an assassination attempt almost came to fruition in vicinity of the Diet. Right after our governor general, Marijan Varešanin opened the Diet and went back to his residence, famous 'Konak', in his carriage, at a bridge crossing Bogdan Žerajić fired five bullets in direction of governor general. Varešanin in shock exited vehicle bewildered only to see dead body of the his assassin. Žerajić killed himself with the last bullet. This vagueness spared us great turmoil throughout the region. He might have acted alone, but it is more likely he had some sort of support. Further investiagion is necessary and immediate!"
ww1_bosnia.1.a: "Serbs should get a hold of themselves!"

ww1_bosnia.2.t: "Concerning Growth of Young Bosnia"
ww1_bosnia.2.d: "Many schools and universities across Bosnia have began to see more political oppositionist agitation coming from a new group called the Mlada Bosna, or the Young Bosnia. Popular among students, this group is causing Bosnian-nationalist agitation and is spreading cancer beliefs like separation from the Austro-Hungarian condominium, igniting a revolution to break free from Austrian chains and even uniting with independent Balkan-slavic nations like Serbia."
ww1_bosnia.2.a: "Is anyone a moderate in this country?"

ww1_bosnia.3.t: "Dev note"
ww1_bosnia.3.d: "Thanks for checking out Bosnia. Bosnia goes through a rough time of authoritarianism in this time period, with censorship and the Bosnian parliament being extremely limited, whilst the governor and Viennese administration are off exploiting the country freely. Rough times, eh?\n\n\nAre you sure you meant to play Bosnia?"
ww1_bosnia.3.a: "I know what I'm doing!"

ww1_bosnia.4.t: "1910 Bosnian Parliamentary Elections"
ww1_bosnia.4.d: "72 Members of Parliament were elected in the results of the Bosnian parliamentary elections. 3 major political parties showed up on the voting booth ballots: the Srpska narodna organizacija, the Muslimanska narodna organizacija and the Hrvatska narodna zajednica. The SNO won 31 seats, the Muslim People's Organization won 24 seats, the Hrvatska narodna zajednica won 12 seats and a new party Hrvatska katolička udruga, won 4 seats. An independant Jewish candidate also won one seat."
ww1_bosnia.4.a: "Progress!"

ww1_bosnia.5.t: "First Session of the Diet Ends"
ww1_bosnia.5.d2: "There were loosened tensions by the Croat and Serb members, as everybody seemed to be coalitioning to advocate for a greater autonomy and self-governance for the nation of Bosnia. Emperor [AUS.GetLeader] has recently visited the city and his presence can still be felt. Diet was opened by general governer Marijan Varešanin and he might have had a favorable impression as the three parties managed to come together and agree on 1910 budget. Hopefully, this good start and pace will be kept in Diet."
ww1_bosnia.5.a: "Sounds promising!"

ww1_bosnia.6.t: "Burian Resigned as Joint Finance Minister"
ww1_bosnia.6.d: "Baron István Burian, the Austro-Hungarian Joint Finance Minister, has resigned from his double post. Succeeding him is Ritter Leon Von Bilinski: we can take the opportunity and present Bilinski a memorandum asking for a very much needed reform in Bosnian politics."
ww1_bosnia.6.a: "Let's ask"

#dagg this event should be seen as austria not as bosnia this shouldnt be transplanted to an austrian focus. they get warning bosnia wants
#no
ww1_bosnia.7.t: "The Bosnian Diet asks for reforms"
ww1_bosnia.7.d: "The Bosnian Diet has sent the Joint Finance Minister a memorandum asking for a revision to rules of procedure in the Bosnian Diet, a certain electoral reform, constitutional reform, for a government responsible to the Bosnian Diet (as the Joint Finance Minister is in charge of that currently), more autonomy in economic and political matters, an independent policy on railway rates and the regulation of language used by Bosnian officials."
ww1_bosnia.7.a: "Block their budget!"

ww1_bosnia.8.t: "Austria refuses memorandum"
ww1_bosnia.8.d: "Bilinski has rejected our demand for more autonomy and control in our internal affairs."
ww1_bosnia.8.a: "Can we negotiate?" #sidz note to self, expand ts

#could be reused for BOS_attempt_negotiations
ww1_bosnia.9.t: "Bosnian Diet proposes negotiation"
ww1_bosnia.9.d: "After having rejected their gullible attempt at more internal autonomy, some of Diet's politicians have come back for negotiations. Time has to pass and all Diet's members will realise they are loosing much more than Vienna without a budget for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Currently, we do not have enough for a 'stable' government, so concessions on Vienna's side might be also necessary..."
ww1_bosnia.9.a: "Let's hear it"

ww1_bosnia.10.t: "Third Diet Session"
ww1_bosnia.10.d: "This third Diet session takes place during a troublesome time in Bosnian politics, as our growing open feud with Vienna has led to many restrictions imposed on us by our overlords. In this Diet session, Austrian officials and the Diet members managed to agree on most of the laws and passing their budget. One law that did not manage to get agreed on was about the language used by officials. The draft stated the language should be Serbo-Croat in all affairs, including in the railways, whilst the government initially took the opposite side and disagreed. With time government conceded on all points but on language use in railways, which was not enough for the Diet. The third Diet session gets prorogued." #sidz note to self, this possibly doesnt make sense check later

#ww1_bosnia.11.t: "Negotiations with the Bosnians conclude"
#ww1_bosnia.11.d: "The Bosnians Diet would obtain more internal and economic autonomy and a reinstatement of their budget, but the session ended with our negotiators disagreeing #with the elected ministers about the language to be used in official Bosnian internal affairs."
#ww1_bosnia.11.a: "Ugh, suspend their sessions already!"

ww1_bosnia.12.t: "The Road Construction Bill fails"
ww1_bosnia.12.d: "When it was proclaimed that Road construction bill failed, you could realise who are optimists in this Diet. Not even 5 faces would make the list, while everyone else, expected these results. Serbian obstructionism according to some has begun and it might be the end of this Diet. Even if this bill failed, roads will have to be constructed, but not under this session..."
ww1_bosnia.12.a: "So... session is over?"

ww1_bosnia.13.t: "The Language Issue"
ww1_bosnia.13.d: "The Language issue was brought up by Serbian lawmakers and other members of parliament today. Demand is total language freedom and usage of Serbo-Croat in all condominiums affairs! An agreement could not be reached: the Serbs decided to boycott and obstruct the Second Diet session."
ww1_bosnia.13.a: "Jebiga..." # sidz, note to self, edit this slop, but first play a game of bosnia

ww1_bosnia.14.t: "Compulsory Education Bill"
ww1_bosnia.14.d: "This new passed law introduces compulsory education for the children of Bosnia, except all in confessionals, female Muslims and any disabled students. It strengthens our grip over schools, making the system more politically-driven, at least to our side. Making school compulsory will drag up the currently low attendance rate. We hope to broaden the inclusion of the education from Sibjan-Mektebis and confessionals to a more centralized, federally funded system that will help drive up the abysmal literacy rate reminiscing of the Ottoman era."
ww1_bosnia.14.a: "We are still at least a century behind."

ww1_bosnia.15.t: "Teachers' petition for a better position"
ww1_bosnia.15.d: "In Bosnia, the position of a teacher is still very undervalued by the government and Bosnian society. The hard-working teachers of Bosnia are petitioning for a better position in society and higher wages. We must rally behind this cause to help literacy rate rise and shift population eventually into something other than agriculture."
ww1_bosnia.15.a: "Of course."

ww1_bosnia.16.t: "Diet tackles Agrarian Question"
ww1_bosnia.16.d: "Bosnia has had a Unresolved Agrarian Question lingering over farmers ever since the Austrians took over the Ottomans: a lot of the land was under a peasant system known as the Kmets system in which few Muslims held large swaths of arable land on which worked many more Serbs. The Bosnian Diet today passed a law that allows the voluntary conversion of Kmets to freehold ownership."
ww1_bosnia.16.a: "Finally!"

ww1_bosnia.17.t: "Second Diet Session Ends"
ww1_bosnia.17.d: "The second Diet session occured today in a troubled time during Bosnian political affairs. The unresolved language issue, the agrarian question and the public fallout with Vienna has left the parliament divided, but the session still takes place, mainly to determine what should happen with Vienna. Still few laws passed, but except these few most will never get even close to majority in this Diet session."
ww1_bosnia.17.a: "Nothing ever happens"

ww1_bosnia.18.t: "Third Diet session organised"
ww1_bosnia.18.d: "The third Diet session has been scheduled a month from now. Last Diet session was horrendous due to unstoppable obstructionism from agitated Serbs. This next Diet session must succeed as it is important to help resolve the ongoing and unresolved political controversies surrounding Bosnia. Budget has been negotiated with majority of the Diet and it is awaited to be passed on next first meeting."
ww1_bosnia.18.a: "Not a promising start"

ww1_bosnia.19.t: "Potiorek succeeds Varešanin"
ww1_bosnia.19.d: "After the assassination attempt on him last year, Marijan Varešanin requested dismissal which was accepted soon. Successor has been found hastingly, who is to be general Oskar Potiorek, candidate for position of Chief of the General Staff."
ww1_bosnia.19.a: "We wish him good luck!"

ww1_bosnia.20.t: "Fourth Diet Session Starts"
ww1_bosnia.20.d: "Although on paper it says that fourth Diet session starts on same day as third session ended, in reality that is a lie. Last session, while an improvement compared to the second session, was again plagued by obstructionalist opposition lead by radical Serbs. Except that language question problem is on the table for more than two years with little to no progress. Due to recent partial elections, Diet begins session with stable and seemingly loyal majority, but masses are stirring and we might not have a lot of time before this powderkeg explodes somewhere nearby."

ww1_bosnia.21.t: "Road Construction Bill"
ww1_bosnia.21.d: "Today, a large packet of plans for road and railway construction was presented to the Diet. The issue presented is that the language use in these infrastructure projects is inadequate for the Bosnian populace. The road and railway signs along with communication with employees in railways is, according to the bill, only in German or in Hungarian, languages that almost no one speaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina except the governor-general and his lackeys. This mentionned bill, although generous, according to most of the diet, is unpassable in its current form. This might be considered a catastrophe as Vienna demanded from governor-general that this law should pass unopposed."
ww1_bosnia.21.a: "Disastrous!"

#ww1_bosnia.22.t: "Leon Bilinski proposes Road Bill again"
#ww1_bosnia.22.d: "After István Burian, the previous Austrian Reichsfinanzminister, failed to help pass the Road Construction Bill in 1911, Bilinski is back with the reworked bill and offers his support to the Diet to help pass it. This time ministry is coming prepared, with a different approach to the rebellious..."
#ww1_bosnia.22.a: "Something is happening"


ww1_bosnia.24.t: "Muslim parties in the Diet merge"
ww1_bosnia.24.d: "Two rivalrying factions, the Muslim People's Organization (MPO) and the Muslim Independant Party, merged together to form the United Muslim Organization today. This fact shouldn't bother many as Muslim Independant Party had no seats in the Diet so in many matters this is just a formal change that eventually may lead to more or less moderate members of the Diet."
ww1_bosnia.24.a: "Interesting"

ww1_bosnia.25.t: "The Croat Parties approach us"
ww1_bosnia.25.d: "Croat parties HNZ and HKU, each in different occasion, pledged support to Vienna and general governor to help pass laws in the Diet, for seemingly no particular benefit. These parties both support Austrian annexation of Bosnia, for they see it as progress to unification with rest of Croats, under a Austrian throne. Some doubt this generousity, but really we got to accept as much support as possible to bypass over 30 oppositionist members of Orthodox block. If they are to be trusted we have now around 30 loyal members of the Diet, which isn't enough, but is progress."
ww1_bosnia.25.a: "Let's see how long that lasts..."

ww1_bosnia.26.t: "Chaos over Language Issue"
ww1_bosnia.26.d: "stuff sidz"
ww1_bosnia.26.a: "Oh God" #sidz note to self, first time issue was Croats, second time Vienna, should there be an event were they let it pass (but in railways or am i going crazy)

ww1_bosnia.27.t: "Second Diet Session starts"
ww1_bosnia.27.d: "First session ended disastrously with attempted road bill passage. Conflicts were there, before voting on it but in this scale most definitely not. Still laws were passed and some loyalties survived the session, but not a single person would call that session satisfactory or anything similar. Second session starts with shaky majority and unanswered questions of how to deal with Serbian obstructionism and how to pass road construction bill."
ww1_bosnia.27.a: "Hope it goes well!"

ww1_bosnia.28.t: "Ali-beg Firdus passes away"
ww1_bosnia.28.d: "This morning, Ali-beg Firdus passed away in Sarajevo. Born in Ottoman Bosnia, he was a prominent figure advocating for Bosniak Muslims' rights, and helped found the Muslim People's Organization. He protested the Austrian annexation of Bosnia in 1908, but still became first speaker of Bosnian Diet. Unfortunately, he spent most of his short tenure in his bed in difficult ails. Nation mourns for this beloved and peaceful figure, often seen as a unifying force of Muslims of all nationalities."

ww1_bosnia.28.a: "Počivao u miru"
ww1_bosnia.28.b: "Airqud fi salam"

ww1_bosnia.29.t: "Sulejman Šarac resigns as Grand Mufti for Bosnia"
ww1_bosnia.29.d: "Sulejman Šarac, an influencial figure for Islam in Bosnia, has resigned as Grand Mufti for Bosnia. He leaves behind a position filled with honor in the islamic world, as he was the highest Islamic legal authority in Bosnia. He states he resigned because he wants to focus on family matters and science."

ww1_bosnia.31.t: "Austria blocks ban on German in internal communications"
ww1_bosnia.31.d: "According to response from Diet's overlords, such demand is unimaginable, rude, disrespectful and unacceptable. Diet is as happy with than response as Vienna with the initial request. Such response to Diet's request, according to superstitious, is a bad omen since this is one of first requests in this direction."
ww1_bosnia.31.a: "Scheiße!"

ww1_bosnia.32.t: "Bosnian Diet removes use of German in internal communication"
ww1_bosnia.32.d: "In an attempt at gaining more autonomy and independance from their overlord, us, Diet of Bosnia and Herzegovina had decided to pass a law in their parliament removing the use of German in their official documents and other internal communications. This is clearly an attack on our relation and our overlordship which cannot be tolerated, no matter the fact that they are a new and unaware government."
ww1_bosnia.32.a: "Block that bill!" #sidz note to self fix ts contradiction

ww1_bosnia.33.t: "Vienna blocks removal of Hungarian on Bosnian railways"
ww1_bosnia.33.d: "Apparrently, Diet's proposal struck a nerve with overlords in Vienna, because response back was humbling. Vienna did not see this as reasonable request, like it is, arguing that this is a condominium and not a off-shore colony. Well, everyone is aware off that, but Hungarian is here more as a joke than a way of communication. Even in those cases it is probably misused. In any case, Diet should hold of any requests Vienna might find brazen."
ww1_bosnia.33.a: "Baszdmeg!"

ww1_bosnia.34.t: "Bosnian Diet plans to remove Hungarian signs on Railways"
ww1_bosnia.34.d: "In a pure defiance to the authority, appeal has been sent from Bosnian Diet 'politely' asking for complete removal of Hungarian signs and language on the Bosnian railways. This shenanigan was apparrently voted upon in newly established Bosnian Diet and eventually passed almost unopposedly. For such disgraceful behaviour, Diet will be reprimanded."
ww1_bosnia.34.a: "What are they thinking of themselves!"
#sidz note to self fix 31-34 incoherent, contradictive

ww1_bosnia.35.t: "Postal Savings Bank Bill"
ww1_bosnia.35.d: "Postal Savings Bank, all Diet members wished so much for, might be bigger of an issue than we've thought. At first everyone was accepting of Austrian proposal for a very much needed bank based in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but soon through hearing the rest of the bill, many realised that there will be not much of autonomy in this bill. Bank in plan is tied to Vienna and doesn't have a thing in connection to the Diet. Loyal elements shruged that off but Serbian members of the Diet which are part of current majority are furious with such proposal. If bill passes, it might be more to goodwill than honesty of the Diet member's hearts."
ww1_bosnia.35.a: "Uh oh"

#ww1_bosnia.36.t: "Second Road Construction Bill"
#ww1_bosnia.36.d: "Reichsfinanzminister Bilinski is keeping his pace and it seems that he is successfully forcing opposition into acceptin his new bill. Well it not really a new bill, refurbishment is a misleading description. Slight changes to the original bill were made, but by no means should they be reason that now this bill passes. Reason is the Budget, fear of losing paychecks, collapse of the Diet and few other threats that make it this time more serious."
#ww1_bosnia.36.a: "Well done, Bilinski!"

ww1_bosnia.37.t: "Vote on Hospital bill"
ww1_bosnia.37.d: "On table is a simple bill, proposing funding into condominium's poorly kept hospitals and further improvements of healthcare along with building a whole new  'Pavilion K' in Sarajevo's Landesspital. All sides are content with this real piece of progress, which will undoubtedly save many lives in its future."
ww1_bosnia.37.a: "Who said Diet is disfunctional?"

ww1_bosnia.38.t: "Diet's own Memorandum"
ww1_bosnia.38.d: "At inner-party conference that occured just now. New finance minister von Bilinski has been offered a rather unusual and brave proposal from Diet members. Their so called 'Memorandum' asked for every possible right they could've thought of. Change of Diet's election system, a general increasal of Diet's rights, higher autonomy of condominium's economy and other unimaginable ideas. They must have thought that new minister is naive and green, but situation is quite opposite. After reading 'Memorandum' he countered with a threat that he will pass road bill without their vote and that budget dismissal hurt more Diet members than him or Empire."
ww1_bosnia.38.a: "Whose idea was this?!"

ww1_bosnia.39.t: "Student Protests get out of hand"
ww1_bosnia.39.d: "Hungarian flag is burning in Sarajevo right now! There is a massive group of protestors, mostly students in all public spaces shouting phrases united no matter of their ethnicites. Every Hungarian, German person and officials are scared to the bone with such sight in front of them. Calling for violence, unification of all Slavs, peace between nationalities, radicalizing public speeches and total disobedience are every person looks at! A general strike has been called for from these students. Secret societies are recruiting and public distrust is at all time high. Something must be done about this situation!"
ww1_bosnia.39.a: "Crush this by any means necessary!"
ww1_bosnia.39.b: "Disperse the crowds, but be careful!"

ww1_bosnia.40.t: "Second Road Construction Bill Passed!"
ww1_bosnia.40.d: "Thanks to Bilinski's way of forcing the issues, now construction can be finished. Technically roads were being built and before the bill passed or even was voted on, the road signs were the issue. Well, law is passed, but Muslims and Serbs are furious and well Croats are not happiest with this too, so new goal should be mending relations to continue the sessions."
ww1_bosnia.40.a: "Storm is over. Right?"

ww1_bosnia.41.t: "Diet Collapse!"
ww1_bosnia.41.d: "Bilinski saved Bosnia by passing budget and road bill, but at a cost of almost half of MPO and all of SNO members leaving Diet session right in the middle of debating minor issues and compensations. Shouting and few threats even were heard all around the building. Members that exited session, claimed that second session is permanently over. Feeling of betrayal was predominant feature on obstructionist's faces along with anger. Session is truly over, but what to do now?"
ww1_bosnia.41.a: "A bit childish"

ww1_bosnia.42.t: "The Croatian Sabor dissolves"
ww1_bosnia.42.d: "The Ban of Croatia-Slavonia, Slavko Cuvaj, has dissolved the Croatian sabor soon after he was elected to power and he suspended the constitution, basically imposing direct rule. Opposition grew in the streets of Croatian cities and towns, and even in Bosnian towns, where a part of the population is and speaks Croatian. Soon joined non-Croat protestors in all out protest to Ban's actions."

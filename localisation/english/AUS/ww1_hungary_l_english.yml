The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parliamentary majority, appointed a strong-dualist.

ww1_hungary_auh.1.d: "The National Party of Work has won contrary to what many forsaw. Many expected F48P to win and cause another compromise government of civil servants for the next 5 years; however due to István Tisza's genius political strategies and the F48P divide the National Party of Work has won! Can we usher in era and progress and rid Hungary of it's nasty feudal look?"
ww1_hungary_auh.1.a: "Hurray!"
ww1_hungary_auh.1.a: "Again?"
ww1_hungary_auh.5.t: "The National Party of Work has won the Hungarian Election"
ww1_hungary_auh.5.d: "The National Party of Work (NMP) has pulled of something of an upset victory in the elections. Not that we should be upset at all, for the NMP is alligned with our goals and committed to the 67' agreemant and seek to promote dualism within Hungary; however they're known to be authoritarian and sometimes stubborn to our wishes. Nonetheless this is great for Austria!"
ww1_hungary_auh.5.a: "The best thing to come from Hungary in a while!"
ww1_hungary_auh.6.t: "Terrible News: The F48P has won the Hungarian Election!"
ww1_hungary_auh.6.d: "Terrible News! We cannot allow a F48P government in Hungary. the F48P is named after the 1848 Hungarian revolution that sought freedom from our monarchy; however, the modern party is opposed to such measures. They on the other hand question the 67' compromise and seek much greater autonomy from us. Like in 1905, Franz Joseph will not accept the results. It seems Hungary looks forward to more turbulent times under a compromise government..."
ww1_hungary_auh.6.a: "Under no condition can the F48P ever rule!"
ww1_hungary_auh.7.t: "King Ferenc Jozsef does not accept the Election Results"
ww1_hungary_auh.7.d: "Like he did in 1905, the King does not accept the F48P victory. Under no condition will he let them rule due to the F48P being so critical of the 67' agreement and dualist idea. It seems that Hungary is due for another few turbulent years. We must find a sensible compromise candidate to rule. No matter who we choose, he'll be unlikely to mediate the division in parliament that'll certaintly come in due time..."

ww1_hungary_auh.8.d: "F48P managed to make a coalition in order to win the 1910 elections and stay around long enough for a compromise government to be established; however, they couldn't put away their differences forever. F48P has once more broken up into a few parties. They will however still remain as an alligned voting block to combat the National Party of Work in parliament..."
ww1_hungary_auh.8.a: "Will they be their own demise?"
ww1_hungary_auh.9.t: "Refounding of the Constitutionalist Party"
ww1_hungary_auh.9.d: "In light of a coalition government being appointed, internal tension in the National Party of Work has started to show. Several prominent members have left and refounded the Constitutionalist Party, with Janos Hadik as its head and the party includes Gabor Ugron Jr. and Gyula Andrassy Jr; however, the NMP still dominates parliment and the Constitutional Party will need to stay vigilant. The Party's goals are moderate, they advocate for some liberal reforms while not fully succumbing to the social-democrat ideas of the F48P..."
ww1_hungary_auh.9.a: "Interesting"
ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich amidst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggravated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály Károlyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to form a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. However, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day on 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the assasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."

ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While Alfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on. Thus we shall relieve him of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."
ww1_hungary.11.a: "We have to point the finger at someone"
ww1_hungary.12.t: "Hungary Meddles in Croat-Serb Relations"
ww1_hungary.12.d: "The Hungarian prime minister Károly Khuen-Héderváry has been passing laws that favor the Serbs living in Vojvodina, to the great disappointment of every Croat nationalist. Khuen-Héderváry has had 'Serbophile' accusations thrown at him ever since becoming the Croatian Ban in 1883. He would remain in this position until 1903, where he would agitate the Croatians by passing acts and bills that favored the Serbs and undermining Croatian authority. Nonetheless Khuen-Héderváry has proven to be very reliable and one of the Dual Monarchy's foremost champions. We must trust in his methods."
ww1_hungary.12.a: "He probably knows what he's doing"
ww1_hungary.13.t: "Károly Khuen-Héderváry Resigns!"
ww1_hungary.13.d: "Károly Khuen-Héderváry has been unable to break the obstructionist opposition, especially around the topic of the annual Defense Bill. For this reason the Prime Minister is resigning, and the Minister of Finances, László Lukács is the one who took his office as the Prime Minister. He might bring the stability this country needs."

Should Hungary also be an official command language? With turbulent times ahead we will either need stronger hearts or more army funding..."

ww1_hungary.15.d: "Hungarian parliament has been tangled in a fierce debate about the Army Question Crisis. Many Hungarians feel it is necessary for Hungarian to become an official command language like German is. Tangled in the fillbuster the Hungarian parliament has resorted to demanding a compensation in te Common Army Funding..."

ww1_hungary.17.t: "Speaker of the House: István Tisza"
ww1_hungary.17.d: "István Tisza has become the speaker of Hungarian Parliament. A controversial man, he has had a previous government briefly from fall of 1903 to late winter of 1904. His premiership is seen as a failure and led to the Liberal Party losing parliamentary majority for the first time in three decades. Tisza's critics are opposed to him due to his often authoritarian leadership. Tisza is also opposed to a more liberal suffrage system and often favours companies then workers; however Tisza can inspire economic growth and promote unity within the Ausgleich"

ww1_hungary.19.t: "Bloody Thursday"
ww1_hungary.19.d: "In response to István Tisza becoming speaker of the House with the goal of breaking the opposition's obrstruction, workers have taken to the streets of Budapest calling for equal suffrage, better living conditions and the removal of Tisza. The protests have escalated to riots which have been escalated by the Socialists (MDZP) who took a large part in rallying the workers. The demonstration would end that evening after threats; however, tragically lead to many injuries, damage to local shops and transport and the death of six. Tisza and the Lukacs remain unwavered from their goals."

ww1_hungary.20.d: "Speaker Tisza has taken upon himself to force the army bill through. The oppposition attampted to excercise their parlimentary rights and requested that a closed session be held; however, Tisza denied their reuqest and ordered voting to procede despite it going against House rules. Despite the fierce opposition, Tisza ordered local police to forcefully remove members who dare vote in opposition or quote on quote protest, become angry or violent. Without a debate and no opinion allowed from the opposition the Defense Bill has passed. István Tisza has become a hated man in Hungarian politics, but regardless the crisis that's plagued Hungary for the last decade may finally be resolved. With the passing of the bill the annual contingent of recruits has been raised... Much to the pleasure of the King."

Gyula Kovács took his suspension very personally and as a result today he suddenly burst into the opposition-free chamber with a revolver in his hand and, jumping down from the journalists' gallery and running between the rows of benches, exclaiming "There is still an opposition member here!", shot at Tisza three times, who was unable to move from shock. By the grace of god none of the shots hit. Gyula Kovács would attempt to commit suicide with the 4th shot; however, the bullet seems to have not caused any serious injury."

From a young age he has been energetic and joined the Hungarian parliament in the early 1870s. During the Russo-Turkish war (1877) Gábor Ugron and some colleagues whom had great English connections, felt sympathy for Constantinople and devised a plan to rectruit a few thousand Székelys (Hungarians living in Eastern Transylvania) and arm them in order for them to march into Romania and disrupt Russia's supply lines to grant the Ottomans an oppurtunity to have a counter-attack. During a weapons shipment the horses were spooked and weapons crates fell and broke; revealing the plot. The prime minister of the time, Kalman Tisza (father of István Tisza) figured out Gábor Ugron was one of the conspirators. Reluctantly he began preparations to arrest Gábor Ugron; however, made sure to give him plenty of time shave his beard and head and buy glasses to run off to Italy. He would eventually return to Hungary. Gábor Ugron would support independence policies and join F48P in 1884. On December 20th 1891, Gábor Ugron dueled with Baron Géza Fejérváry in the Franz Joseph cavalry barracks, his assistants were Kornél Ábrányi Jr. and Count Gábor Bethlen. Ugron would also oppose the Triple Alliance and Austria's reliance on Germany, for Ugron favored an alliance with the Entente, specifically France. Ugron even conspired for such a plot, not that it'd come to fruition. He'd also have many failed buisness ventures. King Franz Joseph offered him a barony. Ugron responded: “Don't give me a Habsburg rank, my family already had a rank and name in this region, when the wind hadn't even brought the news of his majestic family here.”  When giving one of his last speeches, he unexpectedly interrupted himself and asked for a break and went out into the corridor. His son (Ugron Jr.) hurried out in terror after him; the old man must be unwell. But no. He was standing by the telephone in the hallway, dialing his apartment to tell the cook to put the duck in the oven now, so that it would be at its best by the time he finished and got home."

After his fall he still remained relevant for his opinion on the Magyarization of nationalities should be promoted by all available means, but at the same time, not even the slightest gap should be opened for the cultural, linguistic or other aspirations of nationalities. As an important tool for Magyarization, he recommends the nationalization of public education as opposed to denominational schools, as well as settlements, continuously along the borders of Hungarian ethnic blocs. He also draws attention to the acceleration of the Magyarization process of family and settlement names . He also recommends that domestic servants who do not speak Hungarian should not be employed, and that Hungarians should not buy from market vendors who do not know Hungarian.

Tisza theorizes a stronger German, Austro-Hungarian, Romanian pact to prevent the Russian behemoth.

Our alliance with Romania is crucial to offset Russia; however, with the developing movements in Transylvania our alliance with them is at risk... Due to the stubborness of Hungary the Transylvanian-Romanians are starting to question the entire format of the dual-monarchy. Peter Mihályi, a Transylvanian-Romanian in the Hungarian Parliament is soon to meet with Tisza and Lukács and seeks the Archduke's advice in organizing a lists of demands to hand over to Tisza and Lukács..."

The meeting was scheduled after Tisza was reassured that Mihályi and the Romanian National Party "occasionally compelled to take an uncompromising tone' by radicals in the party, it nevertheless wholly suppported Hungary's present constitution"; Mihályi presented a list of 11 demands to Tisza and Lukács. They included Romanian language classes at all levels in state, municipal, and denominational schools; greater autonomy for the Uniate Church; use of the Romanian language in public administration and the courts; total freedom of association and the press; and some fifty parliamentary seats to reflect their share of the population..."

To our disappointment, the Romanian National Party has submitted an even larger list of demands, including: instruction of Romanian students should go on in Romanian; the government should modify Article XXVII, 1907, and acknowledge the right of the two Romanian denominations to maintain schools even where ecclesiastical schools had already been shut. Moreover, the Romanian Churches sbould be invested with the right of inspecting ecclesiastical elementary schools, and the state-school inspectors should be selected from those cherishing kindly feelings toward Romanian-language instruction. State school-inspectors should control schools in common with the Churches and act uniformly in disciplinary procedures. It was also deroanded that priests might also be employed temporarily as teachers, and their Churches might also establish Romanian-language secondary and vocational schools. To achieve this, the government is expected to give financial aid to the Churches. The mandatory instruction of the Romanian language and literature and the right of denominations and societies to set up boarding schools in Romanian-inhabited regions were also stipulated in the m.emorandum. The instruction of Romanian pupils in religion should uniformly by performed by Romanians. Due respect must be paiil to the traditions of the Romanian people, and this must be given proper emphasis in the plans of tuition as well.

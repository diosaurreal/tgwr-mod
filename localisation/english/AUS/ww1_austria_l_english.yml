AUS_revise_the_army_law_1889: "Revise the 1889 Army Law"
AUS_revise_the_army_law_1889_desc: "The army law of 1889 is very outdated, limiting the annual recruitment, with the parliament at the time rejecting an essential increase in the recruitment numbers. With tensions escalating, it is necessary a new army law is passed, before our enemies capitalize on this unforgiving mistake we have allowed to happen. This must not end on a single increase but a consistent and increasing annual recruitment allowing our glorious army to reach standards expected of a true great power!"
AUS_improve_army_training: "Improve Army Training"
AUS_improve_army_training_desc: "Many elements of our army haven't been reformed in a long time, including army training. Our army has not fought a single war for decades! Last conflict was against tiny Bosnian resistance during 1878. Army chiefs need to be reminded that wartime might come around soon, for which we need to show and prove our best."
AUS_approve_new_fortification_projects: "Approve New Fortification Projects"
AUS_approve_new_fortification_projects_desc: "As our relations strain with our former ally Italy, we must check on the border and improve our existing defences. Alps although already a good ground for defence are a challenging terrain forces staying there cannot be placed in larger numbers unless accomodated and properly defended. So, to gain total control over these areas our fortifications need further expansion before traitorous cowards on our western border enters the fight."

AUS_establish_army_reserves_desc: "Mobilization is a complex topic not just across our realm but across the globe. Our multi-ethnic population often resists conscription which is an essential cog in machinery of our army. Therefore, we must establish army reserves sufficient for this impending war, war of our lifetimes. Army reserves need to be increased this very moment, because no matter what we do it's a long and gruelling process that must not set us back in any metric behind other great powers."
AUS_end_serbia: "Crush the Slavic Threat"
AUS_end_serbia_desc: "All preparations are finished. All precautions are taken. Our armies are in place and ready.

AUS_focus_on_the_defense: "Focus on the Defense"
AUS_focus_on_the_defense_desc: "Our army is large, however it is unorganized and divided. Such army should not focus on attack, for Conrads' courageous plans of constant attacking are in question due to his tunnel vision and lack of undisputed and reliable knowledge about enemy forces. Besides, positive effects of defense on Empires' core territories might bring an fervour among some of our low-spirited units recruited from grounds of borderlands. Although we will never doubt the fact that we tower over each and every of our enemies, plan to dig in and let them show their cards might prove much more beneficial than blunt attacks."
AUS_cautious_planning: "Cautious Planning"
AUS_cautious_planning_desc: "Our estimates of Russian forces are somewhat inconsistent and too small for their size. On the other hand Serbian people feel dread at mention of our Empire, which is a powerful tool for conscription and morale. We can never take too much precaution and it is without doubt that we should plan safe and prioritize defense of keypoints. After all, a two front war is incoming and our army hasn't seen warfare in any recent history. Every step we take must be thought-through and prepared for anything they throw at us."
AUS_adapt_new_infantry_tactics: "Adapt to New Infantry Tactics"
AUS_adapt_new_infantry_tactics_desc: "Infantry tactics have changed a lot since our last conflicts as modernization of warfare has skyrocketed. Our infantry is in great shape, but to achieve striking victories and to capitalize on our qualities, we need the newest possible tactics to surprise our inferior enemies. Along with modernization we should continue mending the conscription issue too before there grows a difference in quality between new and current soldiers."

The Minister President has been giving long speeches to the ministers in government and the emperor himself, justifying the need for swift and decisive action to bolster Austria's military power. Yet, Czech and liberal obstructionists in the Imperial Council are putting the nation under threat, refusing to pass needed legislation to defend the empire.

He claims that Serbia and Montenegro securing a border with eachother would strengthen relations between both states too much, and will increase the chance that Serbia annexes Montenegro.

Because the local parties have no chance at winning a majority in parliament, a vote for them could arguably be a waste, compared to voting for Deutscher Nationalverband, which may actually win.

This, combined with Serbian border security on our border being lower as their government prioritizes war with the Ottoman Empire, is leading to a large increase in smuggling campaigns from Serbia to Bosnia.

ww1_austriahungary.35.d: "German right-wing nationalism has been on the steady decline in Austria, usually performing quite poorly in elections. With the monarchy generally opposing all forms of nationalism, including German nationalism, they've felt ostracized from the politics of the Christian Social Party, the largest right-wing party in Austria, closely aligned with the Habsburg Crown. The liberals in recent years have been forming coalitions with some German nationalists, yet these German nationalists are usually not right-wing at all, instead agreeing with most of the ideas of the liberals. Small in numbers, right-wing German nationalists know they'd airball at gaining a substantial number of seats in parliament, yet their group is large enough that throwing the towel behind one party could help boost it, and increase their leverage within that party. The question is what party to go with."

With elections coming up in Austria, many in the SAO wish to employ the SPD's help.

It's a move nobody in the government is seriously considering, yet Aehrenthal, our top diplomat, has taken particular offense to the suggestion.

ww1_austriahungary.3.b: "Not while they occupy Bukovina!"
ww1_austriahungary.4.t: "[ROM.GetName] accepts trade agreement"
ww1_austriahungary.4.d: "After being invited to Vienna, Romanian delegates and our representatives have agreed on a mutually beneficial trade agreement that will strenghen our relationship for the future. In addition, they've accepted our cultural exchange treaty, which should hopefully increase our influence over their country."

ww1_austriahungary.5.t: "Romania Refuses Treaty"
ww1_austriahungary.5.d: "Romanian delegates have refused our offer of a treaty, claiming it would not be fair to them. Although Romania is supposed to be our friends, this clearly shows discontent with us amongst the Romanians."

ww1_austriahungary.61.d: "The 'Black Hand', a ultranationalist yugoslavist group, has been formed in Serbia. Their explicit goals are the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the unification of Serbia with our southern territories. No doubt, they're already attempting sabotage campaigns against us in Bosnia, and we must stay watchful. Although their influence is quite low now, they may grow in strength overtime."
ww1_austriahungary.61.a: "A bunch of wild animals!"
ww1_austriahungary.66.t: "Ratification of New Military Budget"
ww1_austriahungary.66.d: "The Hungarian parliament has for some time now refused to ratify a higher military budget, still seeking key concessions from Austria. With Hungary now satisified as well as some clever political maneuvers from pro-military spending politicians on both sides of the empire, this budget has finally passed and been ratified. Thus, the rewards from it can now be reaped."
ww1_austriahungary.66.a: "Great!"
ww1_austriahungary.68.t: "Death of Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal "
ww1_austriahungary.68.d: "Our current foreign minister, having been quite aged, unfortunately died yesterday. Aehrenthal's legacy of careful diplomacy and bridge-building will be remembered amongst Austrians for ages, his service no doubt making the country stronger and better. The cynical yet necessary question now arises on who to replace him with. Someone like Count Ferdinand von Trauttmansdorff may help continue the legacy of Aehrenthal, while someone like Count Berchtold may take a more assertive and forceful approach to foreign politics"
ww1_austriahungary.68.a: "Count Berchtold, your on!"
ww1_austriahungary.68.b: "Count Ferdinand von Trauttmansdorff seems like the man for the job"
ww1_austriahungary.125.t: "Revolution In Hungary"
ww1_austriahungary.125.d: "In response Franz Ferdinand's enforcement of universal suffrage on Hungary, Hungarian revolutionaries both on the street and in high politics have staged a coup, declaring a constitutinoal crisis in the empire and attempting to enforce Hungarian independence. While much of the military remains loyal to Ferdinand, enough have defected to the rebels that its expected to be a real rebellion."
ww1_austriahungary.125.a: "No matter the outcome, the empire will never be the same again"
ww1_austriahungary.67.t: "Austria-Hungary Condemns our Treatment of Christians"
ww1_austriahungary.67.d: "Our government has rightfully treated traitors in the Balkans quite harshly, and yet it seems Austria-Hungary thinks its their business. Austria's foreign minister has issued a strong condemnation of our treatment of Christians in the Balkans, going as far as to threaten an intervention if things don't change. We've concluded an actual intervention seems quite unlikely, and this posturing is most likely just to build good will amongst separatist groups in the Ottoman Empire."

ww1_austriahungary.86.t: "Responding to Austrian Aggression"
ww1_austriahungary.86.d: "It appears Austria may be preparing to invade Serbia, something which would be unacceptable for us. In order to try and cool Austria down, we must remind them of the possible consequences such an action would lead to. Perhaps a strongly worded letter may achieve this."

ww1_austriahungary.87.d: "Our movement of troops to Bosnia and the Serbian border have lead to Russia lobbying a diplomatic protest to our government. They have, in vague terms, stated that unnecessary aggression from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to Serbia would not be accepted by Russia. In practical terms, they're telling us that if we strike Serbia, they will militarily defend Serbia. We have no way of knowing if they're bluffing or not, but we should heed their warning carefully."
ww1_austriahungary.87.a: "An expected note from them"
ww1_austriahungary.85.t: "Austro-Hungarian Troop Movements in the Balkans"
ww1_austriahungary.85.d: "The outbreak of war between the Balkan League and the Ottoman Empire has lead to series of hasty negotiations between the major powers of Europe, desperately trying to prevent the war from escalating. The detected mass movement of Austro-Hungarian troops to the Serbian Border has certainly not calmed the fears of these great powers, as tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia continue to rise. It's no secret many in the Austro-Hungarian empire have sought a pre-emptive strike against Serbia, and many worry Austria may be going down that path."
ww1_austriahungary.85.a: "We're simply preparing for anything!"
ww1_austriahungary.85.b: "God, are they going to drag us into a world war?"
ww1_austriahungary.85.c: "They wouldn't dare!"
ww1_austriahungary.81.d: "The eruption of a massive war directly southern of us requires a strong response from us. Hawkish members of the government are outright calling for a strike against Serbia, claiming war with Serbia is clearly inevitable, and we should start it on our terms, while they're still weak and distracted with their war against the Ottoman Empire. It would surely be an easily victory in theory, yet in reality it would risk Russian intervention, which would start a war between the Entente and the Triple Alliance. More pacifist members in the government think we should take a more cool-headed approach. Recognizing the chaos at the southern border, they believe we should demand Serbia sign a treaty with us to help ensure border security and help smoothen out smuggling operations."
ww1_austriahungary.81.a: "Serbia's actions are destroying the peace in the Balkans. We need to strongly condemn them!"
ww1_austriahungary.81.b: "Serbias actions are risking the stability of the Balkans. They need to fix this!"

ww1_austriahungary.84.t: "Mass Movement of Troops to Bosnia"
ww1_austriahungary.84.d: "The outbreak of war in the Balkans between the Balkan League and the Ottoman Empire could easily spread to us if we're not careful. With Serbian agents in Bosnia attempting to cause a revolution, we must be prepared for a possible war. By deploying a large force to Bosnia, we can ensure we're prepared for anything, and send a clear message to Serbia."
ww1_austriahungary.84.a: "Begin the deployments!"
ww1_austriahungary.82.t: "Austria Demands Treaty on Border Security"
ww1_austriahungary.82.d: "The outbreak of war in the Balkans has lead to a spike of activity from Young Bosnia and the Black Hand, being whipped into a frenzy by our war of liberation in the Balkans as well as having the advantage of a less secure Austrian border, as our forces focus on the war with the Ottoman Empire. It seems these groups are causing issues for Austria, who has come to our government with a demand. They are demanding we increase security on the border to try and weaken these groups."
ww1_austriahungary.82.a: "We'll agree, to prevent their wrath."
ww1_austriahungary.83.t: "Serbia Agrees to Increase Border Security"
ww1_austriahungary.83.d: "Serbia has agreed to ramp up the arrests of smugglers from their side of the Austro-Serbian border, which should help us deal with the issue. Although Serbia is still clearly an enemy country due to their actions in the Balkans, this deal does open up the ability of future peaceful co-existance between our two countries."
ww1_austriahungary.83.a: "Good"
ww1_austriahungary.112.t: "A Fragile Economy"
ww1_austriahungary.112.d: "Austria's economy isn't exactly ready for a war scale war of attrition. Although this war is likely to be over soon, if this war did last for years, we're sure to suffer greatly. We must ensure our economy can stay afloat until then."
ww1_austriahungary.112.a: "Who knew a war with half the world wasn't good for business?"
ww1_austriahungary.138.t: "Investigation of Suspicious Mail"
ww1_austriahungary.138.d: "The investigation of suspicious mail has lead to an interesting discovery. A letter was discovered containing a significant amount of money and several addresses used for espionage activities. A duplicate letter was later posted with the same name, Nikon Nizetas. Police detectives were put at the post office to follow whoever collected it and when the letter was claimed a few weeks later, police pursued but the person who claimed the mail left in a taxi. The detectives got the same taxi and asked to be brought to the place where the last passanger had been taken to and arrived at the Hotel Klomser. They had found a pen-knife sheath in the taxi, which they asked hotel management to ask guests if anyone had lost it, and when a guest arrived to claim it, it turned out to be Alfred Redl, the former head of the Evidenzbureau."
ww1_austriahungary.138.a: "Interrogate him!"
ww1_austriahungary.139.t: "Interrogation of Alfred Redl"
ww1_austriahungary.139.d: "With Alfred Redl being caught receiving the suspicious envelopes without his name, he was interrogated in his hotel room by some military officers. In the interrogation, he admitted to selling military intelligence to a foreign power, the Russians, and serving foreign states on a large scale in the years 1910 and 1911. Army chief of staff Conrad von Hötzendorf ordered for him to be left alone with a loaded revolver, and in the morning hours he was found dead after killing himself."
ww1_austriahungary.139.a: "How much do the Russians know?"

ww1_austriahungary.123.t: "Austria Forces Universal Suffrage Upon Us!"
ww1_austriahungary.123.d: "Franz Ferdinand today signed a decree enforcing universal suffrage on us, something clearly violating our right to sovereignty! This move is meant to dilute the power of Hungarians in the Hungarian government, instead stacking it with non Magyar minority groups who can now vote in Hungarian elections. This is unacceptable, and may be a breaking point for many."
ww1_austriahungary.123.a: "We must reconsider our status in the dual monarchy!"
ww1_austriahungary.121.t: "Riots in Budapest"
ww1_austriahungary.121.d: "As Ferdinand appoints a loyalist to the head of Hungary's government, organic resistance is brewing from civilians. In Budapest, Hungarians are rioting against the new leadership, calling for August to be ousted and for Hungary to have popular sovereignty over its leadership."
ww1_austriahungary.121.a: "We will watch the situation carefully"
AUS_mandate_for_leadership: "Mandate for Leadership"
ww1_austriahungary.124.t: "Several Politicians Declare Constitutional Crisis"
ww1_austriahungary.124.d: "In reponse to Franz Ferdinand declaring universal suffrage law of the land in Hungary, many Hungarian politicians are seeing the issue as a breaking point. Austria directly enforcing its will on Hungary is clearly illegal and unacceptable, and allowing this to go through would effectively end Hungary's independence."
ww1_austriahungary.124.a: "They're right!"
ww1_austriahungary.122.t: "Universal Suffrage in Hungary"
ww1_austriahungary.122.d: "The next move to destroy the Hungarian elite is to introduce universal suffrage in Hungary. This move would greatly expand the power of Romanians, Slovaks, and Slavs in Hungary, thus reducing the power of Hungarians. With this, we can ensure Hungay doesn't have a strong core opposition built up to us."
ww1_austriahungary.122.a: "Let's sign it into law!"
ww1_austriahungary.117.t: "Sacking The Hungarian Government"
ww1_austriahungary.117.d: "The Hungarian government is full of officials that antagonize Ferdinand, who are seeking greater autonomy from Austria, who must be curtailed. With the powers vested in the Emperor, Ferdinand can begin clearing up the Hungarian government. The most egregious actors must be removed, with a loyal head of state being appointed to support our agenda. "
ww1_austriahungary.117.a: "And removed, they will be!"
ww1_austriahungary.119.t: "Ferdinand Appoints New Hungarian Head of State"
ww1_austriahungary.119.d: "Ferdinand has appointed an old ally of Austria, Joseph August as head of Hungary. August is aligned with Ferdinand's agenda, and is expected to provide him support as he completely screws over Hungary. Hopefully, organic resistance on the streets will grow to his agenda..."
ww1_austriahungary.119.a: "What the hell?"
ww1_austriahungary.120.t: "The Programme for the Sucessesion"
ww1_austriahungary.120.d: "A series of key advisors to Franz Ferdinand have began preparing for the eventual coronation of the Archduke, seeing his fathers time as coming to an end relatively soon. The written text prepares for Ferdinand to immediately complete his agenda as effectively as possible. This text is expected to help prepare him to crush Hungary, increase centralizing of the empire, and erode what little democracy Austria has."
ww1_austriahungary.120.a: "Interesting..."
ww1_austriahungary.118.t: "Franz Ferdinand Delaying Coronation?"
ww1_austriahungary.118.d: "Despite having been king of Austria for several days, Ferdinand seems to be ignoring calls to accept coronation for King of Hungary. This is raising questions amongst the political establishment, suspecting alterior motives from Ferdinand, a famous opponent of Hungarian interests."
ww1_austriahungary.118.a: "What is his game?"
ww1_austriahungary.116.t: "Delaying Our Coronation of King of Hungary"
ww1_austriahungary.116.d: "While Ferdinand has been crowned King of Austria, he has technically not been crowned King of Hungary yet, meaning he has also not sworn an oath to uphold the Hungarian constitution and legal system. Yet, as emperor of Austria, we retain the de jure power to enact changes in the Hungarian crownland through royal decree. With no obligation to the Hungarian consitution, we technically have an unlimited mandate to reshape the political state of Hungary however we wish. By delaying our coronation in Hungary, we can keep this power long enough to completely crush the Hungarian brats."
ww1_austriahungary.116.a: "Let's get to work..."
ww1_austriahungary.111.t: "New Man in Town"
ww1_austriahungary.111.d: "The ascension of Franz Conrad von Hotzendorf to leader of Austria has brought immediate change to its government. Local governors across Austria have been purged, being replaced with nationalists aligned with him. A series of emergency decrees have been passed, drastically reducing civil liberties across the country. Although parliament hasn't been dissolved yet, its end is seen as likely to come soon."
ww1_austriahungary.111.a: "Bold change is needed!"
ww1_austriahungary.136.t: "Austria forces the Army Bill issue"
ww1_austriahungary.136.d: "Austria has forced upon us the question of the army bill, and demands us to finally end the army crisis."
ww1_austriahungary.136.a: "We're trying"

ww1_austriahungary.115.t: "A Non-Partisan Minister President"
ww1_austriahungary.115.d: "Minister-Presidents of Cisleithania under Emperor Joseph often pursued their own ambitious, independent agendas. Franz Ferdinand intends to be more involved in the political state of the empire, and thus the Minister-President role is expected to become widely ceremonial only, with a puppet being appointed who will rubber stamp Ferdinands agenda."
ww1_austriahungary.115.a: "A much needed improvement"

ww1_austriahungary.137.t: "Picking the Ideal Canidate"
ww1_austriahungary.137.d: "While we've decided to appoint a reformist as Minister-President of Austria, we must now decide the person. [AUS.GetLeader]'s advisors have brought a list of politicans that would fit the goals [AUS.GetLeader]'s agenda. Who should be appointed?"
ww1_austriahungary.137.a: "Max Vladimir Von Beck would be ideal"
ww1_austriahungary.137.b: "Heinrich Lammasch would be good"
ww1_austriahungary.137.c: "Ernest Von Koerber is the best choice"
ww1_austriahungary.128.t: "Minorities Want Out"
ww1_austriahungary.128.d: "Seeing the writing on the wall, many minority groups in the empire are seeking a way out after the takeover of the government by the military lead by Hotzendorf. With Hotzendorf being a hardcore Germanophile, they realize a regime under him would lead to their oppression. Thus, minority groups across the empire have organized and joined Hungary in their rebellion"
ww1_austriahungary.128.a: "All traitors will face a swift end!"
ww1_austriahungary.127.t: "Conspiracy in the Military "
ww1_austriahungary.127.d: "As revolution in Hungary rages on, many in the military are seeing Ferdinand as a poor leader. If Ferdinand can already cause an empire civil war within his first few weeks as leader, who knows if the empire will survive under him by the next year. Germany, angered by Ferdinands more pro Russia outlook, seems to be supporting some sort of military conspiracy against Ferdinand. Is it time for the military to restore order in the empire?"
ww1_austriahungary.127.a: "We must swiftly surround Vienna"
ww1_austriahungary.127.b: "Ferdinand must quickly purge the army!"
ww1_austriahungary.126.t: "The Loneliest Man in Vienna"
ww1_austriahungary.126.d: "Franz Ferdinand, being a authoritarian man with a brash personality, has made few friends amongst the political elite that dominate Austrian politics. Although having a small circle of loyal advisors, most Austrian politicians see Ferdinand as an autocrat who wants to take away their power. Thus, Franz Ferdinand is entering government with few supporters."
ww1_austriahungary.114.t: "Redl Provides Austrian Military Plans"
ww1_austriahungary.114.d: "Redl, our spy in Austria, has delivered us the copy of Austrian war plans against us. We can now utilize these to crush Austria on the battle field, at least until they catch on and redraw them"
ww1_austriahungary.114.a: "Wow! They're screwed!"
ww1_austriahungary.135.t: "The Wehrmann"
ww1_austriahungary.135.d: "As the Great War continues, residents of Vienna have began to participate in unique fundraiser to support the war and show solidarity for the Austrian war spirit. Hundreds of thousands of Viennans are pounding iron nails into the a wooden statue of a soldier in Vienna, attempting to turn the statue into pure iron. They're getting the iron nails through government operated shops, which are allowing civilans to purchase the iron nails to pound into the large statue in exchange for money which is being used to pay out programs for widows of fallen soldiers on the frontline."
ww1_austriahungary.135.a: "A very cool program!"
ww1_austriahungary.107.t: "Pre-Emptive Strike on Serbia?"
ww1_austriahungary.107.d: "With us prevailing against Serbia in the Taslica crisis, many in the army want us to escalate further. Influential figures like Conrad have advocated for a pre-emptive strike against Serbia for years now, and what better time then when Serbia is distracted fighting a war with the Ottoman Empire? Undoubtedly, an attack would cause an international crisis. Yet war with the Entente may be inevitable, and if we attack now, it could start on our terms."
ww1_austriahungary.107.a: "Nonsense. We aren't doing that"
ww1_austriahungary.107.b: "No time for second thoughts, we need to do this"

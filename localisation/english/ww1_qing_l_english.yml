 QIN_beiyang_army_name_desc:0 "Represents §YMilitarist§! and §YArmed Forces§! in general that remained loyal to §YYuan Shikai§!.\n\n§L§YThe Beiyang Army§! had its origins in the Newly Created Army established in late 1895 under §YYuan Shikai's§! command. Unlike its predecessors, it had a formal structure with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and logistical branches, and maintained strict training and discipline. The brigade-sized force was expanded over the years with new recruits and by incorporating other units, before serving as the core of a larger army after Yuan was appointed the §YViceroy of Zhili§! and Northern Ocean Minister in 1901.\n\nThe tensions between £ww1_game_rule_flag_RUS §YRussia§! and £ww1_game_rule_flag_JAP §YJapan§! in §OManchuria§! in early 1904 caused §YEmpress Dowager Cixi§! to agree to Yuan's request to raise more divisions, and he also used his senior position in the Army Reorganization Bureau to prioritize its funding. \n\nFollowing Yuan Shikai's organization of the §YBeiyang Army§!, the army has become China's first professional armed forces. §YYuan Shikai§! had imposed strict discipline and meritocracy within the military to match with the armies of the western foreign powers. However at the same time, some would view Yuan Shikai's organization as a way of making his own personal army against the interest of the §YQing Dynasty§! by Yuan's political rivals during the Dingwei Struggle. Therefore since Yuan's exile by §YPrince Zaifeng§!, the §YManchu Court§! has attempted to take control of the §YBeiyang Army§! and their loyalties.§!"

Their support is vital to the governance of the Qing Dynasty, as without it, the §YImperial Court§! would not be able to enforce its rule beyond the confines of Beijing and to a extent Zhili Province. \n\nWithout their support, adminstration would be near impossible to enforce and angering them could lead to severe consequences. A common goal of the §YChinese Elites§! is to preserve the perceived autonomy and their local political power."

Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War led to loss of suzerainty over Korea and cession of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan. The ambitious Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 proposed fundamental change, but was poorly executed and terminated by the Empress Dowager Cixi in the Wuxu Coup. In 1900, anti-foreign Boxers killed many Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries; in retaliation, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China and imposed a punitive indemnity.\n\nSince then, the central authority has never been so low, and each constituent of the Empire is slowy dissolving into personal agendas.§!"

QIN_1909_advisory_council_election_desc:0 "The 1909 Chinese parliamentary election was an indirect election to the first imperial Advisory Council, a preparatory body of the parliament created under the constitutional reform. With growing calls for constitutionalism across the empire, the Prince-Regent Zaifeng has finally approved for limited provincial elections across the country as a part of the ongoing reforms. For the first time in the Empire's history, members of the Advisory Council would be decided through a nationwide electoral voting. Although only half of the members of the council would be elected as a part of this election with the other half still being directly appointed by the regent this will hopefully appease the constitutionalists enough as to stabilise our increasingly fragile political situation.

QIN_phasing_out_banners_decision_desc:0 "The Qing court tried to reform the Eight Banners to adapt to the current situation and establish a new army. Some of the Beijing Banner troops were organized into the first army. However the results were minimal and could not prevent the decline of the Qing Dynasty and the Eight Banners. We can do nothing other than phasing out the Eight Banners while paying for their pensions."

QIN_tianjin_arsenal_decision:0 "Rebuild the Tianjin Machinery Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_tianjin_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Tianjin Arsenal or the Xigu Arsenal was built in 1873 and is located in the north of Xigu Village in the northern suburbs of Tianjin. It was later burned down during the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. It was not until Yuan Shikai succeeded as the Governor-General of Zhili that he chose a place outside the city of Dezhou, Shandong, to build a new factory. In 1904, the new factory began production, marking the rebirth of the Tianjin Bureau. We will further these efforts to restore military production by expanding and rebuilding the former industrial capabilities of the Tianjin Arsenal."

QIN_anqing_arsenal_decision:0 "Restore the Anqing Arsenal"
QIN_anqing_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Anqing Arsenal was established in the Daguan Pavilion in Anqing, It was one of the earliest modern military industrial enterprise in China which manufactured bullets, gunpowder, guns, and ships. The Anqing Arsenal did not seek foreign help, but relied entirely on domestic resources."

QIN_shanghai_arsenal_decision:0 "Rennovate the Jiangnan General Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_shanghai_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Jiangnan Machinery Manufacturing Bureau was established in Shanghai in 1865. It was a military production organization established during the Westernization Movement of the Qing Dynasty. It was the most important military factory in late Qing China and one of the earliest modern factories. In May 1867, all the equipment originally in Hongkou was moved in. After that, Jiangnan Factory began to manufacture modern internal combustion ships in addition to manufacturing weapons."

QIN_nanjing_arsenal_decision:0 "Revitalize the Jinling Machinery Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_nanjing_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "Jinling Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, was built as a modern industrial building complex in Qinhuai District, Nanjing. The Jinling Arsenal was the first modern mechanized factory in Nanjing, one of the four largest arsenals in China, and the largest modern industrial building complex in China."

QIN_lanzhou_arsenal_decision:0 "Expand in the Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau"
QIN_lanzhou_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau was one the earliest modern industrial enterprise in Northwest China. Planned and established by Zuo Zongtang, the Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau, after several trials, finally successfully imitated guns and cannons with relatively strong lethality under the backward historical conditions at that time. Zuo Zongtang's Lanzhou Manufacturing Bureau successfully imitated the German-made breech-loading screw cannon, which is the world-famous Krupp cannon, and also successfully imitated the Italian heavy artillery and the German breech-loading seven-shot gun."

QIN_hanyang_arsenal_decision:0 "Rejuvenate the Hanyang Arsenal"
QIN_hanyang_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. When the Hanyang Factory started operation, it introduced German rifle technology and mass-produced rifles. The Hanyang Factory had steelmaking and artillery manufacturing equipment from Germany. With these equipment, the Hanyang Factory was able to produce guns, ammunition and their matching gun mounts, becoming one of the few arsenals in China at that time that could produce various types of light and heavy weapons for the arm."

QIN_taiyuan_arsenal_decision:0 "Invest in the Taiyuan Arsenal"
QIN_taiyuan_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "The Shanxi Military Craft Training Factory could have so much more potential but the personnel, organization, and machinery were very simple. With the prospects of many vital resources such as coal, iron and etc around the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi. It might be wise to build up a local arsenal in Shanxi Province around which would have easy access to the mined resources near the city and its strategic geographical location near Zhili makes delivery easier than for example the arsenal in Lanzhou."

QIN_shenyang_arsenal_decision:0 "Invest in the Shenyang Arsenal"
QIN_shenyang_arsenal_decision_desc:0 "On November 29, 1887, the Ministry of Revenue approved the establishment of a bureau in Fengtian to manufacture arms. On December 5, the proposal was approved. General Yiktang'a of Shengjing was ordered to establish the Fengtian Machinery Bureau, which started in June 1899. It did not manufacture arms, but only minted silver coins. Yet it is impossible to manufacture arms for Fengtian.

They alleged that Yang had bypassed the provincial assembly and gained imperial permission to issue the debt directly. After much debate, the PCA decided that Yang did in fact overreach his powers and broke the law, and appealed to the Court for guidance in deciding the punishment. \n\nInstead, our Grand Council shocked the PCA by drafting an edict in the name of the Emperor outright refusing to punish Yang, only criticising him for being careless. The PCA is completely outraged, but powerless in the face of the Emperor's edict. What should we do?"

ww1_xinhai_qing.100.d:0 "Wu Luzhen have shown his true colors, betraying the Empire and siding with the Revolutionaries. Yet the threat he poses looms over the Imperial Court, should Baoding fall in the hands of the revolutionaries then Beijing will be at risk. The Qing court was shocked and suspected that he was a revolutionary, but did not dare to replace him rashly for fear of forcing him to rebel. We have to get rid of Wu before he sabotages us again. We will plot to assassinate Wu Luzhen, by bribing Ma Huitian, the commander of the cavalry battalion and captain of the guard of the Sixth Regiment with a reward of 20,000 yuan. Only then will we have some peace."

Ma Huitian and his men rushed in, saying, "Your Excellency has been promoted, congratulations!" Then he pulled out his pistol and shot, killing Wu Luzhen, Zhang Shiying, and Zhou Weizhen. Blood spills on the office floor and on the desk was a telegram from General Zhang Shaozeng: "Our army is ready to go, please come and join the Shanxi Volunteer Army." with the response from Wu Luzhen: "I am willing to lead 18,000 Yanjin men to follow." The ink was not dry yet. After hearing the gunshots, Xie Lianghan, the station commander who lived only one wall away from Wu Luzhen, stood up and went to rescue him, but was ambushed and injured by the murderers. At this time, the murderers were also firing wildly into the air at the station, creating a serious chaotic atmosphere. Since the revolutionaries in the were now leaderless, most of the soldiers fled and the order was in chaos."

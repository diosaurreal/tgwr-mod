 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Basic Infantry Equipment developed in the 19th Century"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1: "Short Magazine Lee-Enfield MkI"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "A shorter and lighter version of the original MLE—the Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield or SMLE (sometimes spoken as "Smelly", rather than S, M, L, E)—was introduced on 1 January 1904. The barrel was now halfway in length between the original long rifle and the carbine, at 25.2 inches (640 mm). The SMLE's visual trademark was its blunt nose, with only the bayonet boss protruding a small fraction of an inch beyond the nosecap, being modelled on the Swedish Model 1894 Cavalry Carbine."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE MkI"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2: "Short Magazine Lee-Enfield MkIII"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "SMLE MkIII"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "The SMLE MkIII featured a simplified rear sight arrangement and a fixed, rather than a bolt-head-mounted sliding, charger guide. The design of the handguards and the magazine were also improved and the chamber was adapted to fire the new Mk VII High Velocity spitzer .303 ammunition. Many early models, Magazine Lee-Enfield (MLE), Magazine Lee-Metford (MLM) and SMLE, were rebuilt to the Mk III standard. These are called Mk IV Cond., with various asterisks denoting subtypes."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle No. 1 Mk V"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SMLE MkV"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The SMLE design was a relatively expensive long arm to manufacture, because of the many forging and machining operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments resulting in design changes were carried out to help with these problems, reducing the number of complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The SMLE Mk V (later Rifle No. 1 Mk V), adopted a new receiver-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel."

# Events
ww1_morocco.1.t: "Insurrection in Fès"
ww1_morocco.1.d: "Tribesmen opposed to Sultan Abd al-Hafid's rule and his unpopular reforms have marched on Fès. The rebels now lay siege to the capital, trapping the Sultan within the city walls. Without external aid, the Sultan's reign is certain to end.\n\nIn a desperate plea, the Sultan has requested aid from French forces garrisoned in Casablanca to break the siege. French intervention, however, would undoubtedly be used as a pretext to assert further control over Morocco, potentially leading to its full absorption into their colonial empire. With popular opinion already against a ruler seen as a French puppet, this crisis forces a difficult choice upon the people of Morocco."
ww1_morocco.1.a: "We must ask General Moinier for aid."
ww1_morocco.1.b: "The Sultan has betrayed Morocco!"
ww1_morocco.1.c: "The loyal Caïds must intervene!"

ww1_morocco.2.t: "The Fès Expedition"
ww1_morocco.2.d: "Following a plea from Sultan Abd al-Hafid, General Moinier has led a force of 23,000 men from Casablanca to Fès. He swiftly scattered the besieging rebel forces, who have since retreated to the countryside near Marrakech. In the aftermath, the Sultan has abdicated in favour of his brother, Moulay Yousef, though this has done little to placate the ongoing rebellion.\n\nThis situation presents a significant opportunity to expand our colonial influence in North Africa. Using the pretext of protecting European citizens and assets, we could establish a formal protectorate over Morocco. This would certainly provoke a diplomatic crisis with the German Empire, but the Foreign Minister is confident that with British support, we can secure our prize with only minimal concessions."
ww1_morocco.2.a: "Begin the occupation."
ww1_morocco.2.b: "Avoid escalating the situation."

ww1_morocco.3.t: "Moroccan Rebellion Succeeds"
ww1_morocco.3.d: "The Sultan's refusal to call for French aid has proven fatal to his rule. The popular uprising in Fès has succeeded in overthrowing him, and the French gendarmerie stationed in the capital were overwhelmed and slaughtered by rebellious Moroccan troops.\n\nThis affront to French authority cannot be ignored. Our forces in the region have already begun to mobilise to restore order."
ww1_morocco.3.a: "We will restore order."
ww1_morocco.3.b: "We should not interfere."

ww1_morocco.4.t: "France Occupies Fès"
ww1_morocco.4.d: "In response to a plea from the Moroccan Sultan, French troops have entered and occupied the capital city of Fès, scattering the rebel forces that had him under siege. The French government has declared its intention to restore order and protect European interests in the region, a move that is being watched closely by other powers. It remains to be seen how this will affect the delicate balance of power in North Africa."
ww1_morocco.4.a: "A war over a piece of sand?"

ww1_morocco.5.t: "Morocco Declares Independence"
ww1_morocco.5.d: "An attempt by France to establish a protectorate over Morocco has failed. Moroccan forces have successfully resisted the European troops, leading to a major crisis in the region. The Sultan has been overthrown, and the new government has repudiated all foreign influence in the country.\n\n[FRA.GetNameDefCap] is now preparing for a full-scale military intervention to assert its authority."
ww1_morocco.5.a: "This will surely provoke a crisis."

ww1_morocco.6.t: "German Gunboat Arrives in Agadir"
ww1_morocco.6.d: "The German Empire has dispatched the gunboat SMS Panther to the port of Agadir, under the pretext of protecting German trade interests following our intervention in Morocco. The larger cruiser SMS Berlin arrived days later. Our diplomats have been in contact with their German counterparts, and we fully expect that the Kaiser will soon present us with his demands."
ww1_morocco.6.a: "Let us hope their demands are not too steep..."

ww1_morocco.8.t: "Germany Demands Compensation"
ww1_morocco.8.d.forcongo: "After a tumultuous period of back and forth between us and the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm's demands have been received by our foreign minister. They outline that as compensation for the French annexation of Morocco, we must cede the French Congo to German colonial administration. This demand is not unreasonable, and we should prepare ourselves to accept them, to guarantee European peace even if the press continues to criticise our negotiations. However, should we refuse these demands, we need to mobilise ourselves and inform our allies.."
ww1_morocco.8.d.forsouthmorocco: "After a tumultuous period of back and forth between us and the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm's demands have been received by our foreign minister. They outline that as compensation for the French annexation of Morocco, we must cede southern Morocco to German Administration. This demand is not unreasonable, and we should prepare ourselves to accept them, to guarantee European peace even if the press continues to criticise our negotiations. However, should we refuse these demands, we need to mobilise ourselves and inform our allies."
ww1_morocco.8.d.forfreemorocco: "After a tumultuous period of back and forth between us and the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm's demands have been received by our foreign minister. They outline that as compensation for the French annexation of Morocco, we must cede release the protectorate of Morocco and leave the country. This demand is not unreasonable, and we should prepare ourselves to accept them, to guarantee European peace even if the press continues to criticise our negotiations. However, should we refuse these demands, we need to mobilise ourselves and inform our allies."
ww1_morocco.8.a: "Accept the demands in full"
ww1_morocco.8.b: "Suggest a compromise"
ww1_morocco.8.c: "Germany is in no position to demand anything!"
ww1_morocco.8.e: "They can have Southern Morocco"
ww1_morocco.8.f: "We must leave Morocco"

ww1_morocco.9.t: "Germany Demands a Protectorate"
ww1_morocco.9.d: "German diplomats have delivered a stunning ultimatum: either cede Western Morocco to be placed under their protection, or they will intervene militarily. It is clear they are willing to risk war over this matter."
ww1_morocco.9.a: "Take it and be gone."
ww1_morocco.9.b: "What comedians!"

ww1_morocco.10.t: "France Cedes Neukamerun"
ww1_morocco.10.d: "Our diplomats have informed us that the crisis with France has been settled peacefully. Fearing a wider war, the French have agreed to cede a portion of the French Congo as compensation for their gains in Morocco. While not the grand colonial victory some had hoped for, we have secured a valuable concession and asserted our influence on the world stage."
ww1_morocco.10.a: "No war this year then."

ww1_morocco.11.t: "The Agadir Crisis Resolved!"
ww1_morocco.11.d.forcongo: "After a period of intense negotiations, French and German diplomats have resolved the Agadir Crisis. In exchange for German recognition of a French protectorate in Morocco, France has ceded the territory of 'Neukamerun' from the French Congo to German Cameroon. Europe can breathe a sigh of relief, for now. This outcome is a significant, if not total, success for [GER.GetNameDef], though the crisis has also strained international relations."
ww1_morocco.11.d.forsouthmorocco: "After a period of intense negotiations, French and German diplomats have resolved the Agadir Crisis. As a compromise, France will annex northern Morocco while ceding the south to the German Empire as a protectorate. Europe can breathe a sigh of relief, for now. This outcome has expanded German influence in Africa, though the crisis has also strained international relations."
ww1_morocco.11.d.forfreemorocco: "After a period of intense negotiations, French and German diplomats have resolved the Agadir Crisis. Under significant international pressure, the French have agreed to withdraw their troops and respect Moroccan sovereignty, returning the area to the status quo. Europe can breathe a sigh of relief, for now. This outcome is a diplomatic victory for [GER.GetNameDef], though the crisis has also strained international relations."
ww1_morocco.11.a: "Peace at last."
ww1_morocco.11.b: "At least we gained something..."
ww1_morocco.11.c: "A clear victory for our nation!"

ww1_morocco.12.t: "France Rejects German Demands"
ww1_morocco.12.d: "This afternoon, we received word that the French government has rejected our demands over the crisis in Agadir. Their nation is now beginning to mobilise its army, and our own military command is calling for an immediate response. We are at a crossroad: back down and face international humiliation, or declare war and plunge Europe into a conflict of untold scale. The Kaiser and his government must decide."
ww1_morocco.12.a: "Begin mobilisation."
ww1_morocco.12.b: "We must back down."

ww1_morocco.13.t: "Germany Occupies Western Morocco"
ww1_morocco.13.d: "In a stunning move to prevent a wider war, France has ceded the Agadir region to Germany. German forces have now entrenched themselves in Western Morocco, a development that will undoubtedly shift the balance of power in Africa and beyond. For now, peace holds... but for how long?"
ww1_morocco.13.a: "Germany's appetite for a 'place in the sun' grows..."

ww1_morocco.14.t: "Germany Refuses to Back Down!"
ww1_morocco.14.d: "Despite a stock market crash and immense financial pressure, the German Empire has not backed down from the crisis in Agadir and has now begun to mobilise its army. In response, the French are following suit. We have affirmed our support for [FRA.GetNameDef] and advocated for a peaceful resolution, but the situation grows more tense by the hour."
ww1_morocco.14.a: "Perhaps we pushed them too far."
ww1_morocco.14.b: "We will be home by Christmas!"
ww1_morocco.14.c: "We must monitor this situation closely."

ww1_morocco.15.t: "The Crisis Fades Away"
ww1_morocco.15.d: "Germany delayed negotiations without putting forward any demands on France. The government of the empire criticizes the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the slowness and passivity in the conflict."
ww1_morocco.15.a: "A missed opportunity!"

ww1_morocco.16.t: "British Involvement in the Agadir Crisis"
ww1_morocco.16.d: "The United Kingdom has formally announced its support for our position in the current negotiations, giving us significant leverage against Germany. Furthermore, they have dispatched a battleship to Agadir as a clear demonstration of this support on the international stage."
ww1_morocco.16.a: "Excellent. Let us apply more pressure."

ww1_morocco.17.t: "Financial Turmoil in Berlin"
ww1_morocco.17.d: "The escalating crisis in Agadir has triggered financial panic in the German Empire. It was made public this morning that the stock market has plunged by 30% in a single day. Economists warn that the Reichsbank could lose a fifth of its gold reserves, potentially forcing Germany off the gold standard unless the government can resolve the situation.\n\nWhispers in financial circles even suggest French sabotage, aimed at weakening our position through economic warfare."
ww1_morocco.17.a: "Scheisse..."

ww1_morocco.18.t: "Financial Crisis Worsens"
ww1_morocco.18.d: "Our refusal to back down over Morocco has had dire consequences for our economy. The financial crisis continues to deepen, and we now face the very real possibility of being forced off the gold standard."
ww1_morocco.18.a: "Damn the Reichsbank!"

ww1_morocco.19.t: "Moroccans Request Autonomy"
ww1_morocco.19.d: "Following our victory in the Great War, Moroccan representatives have requested that their nation be placed under the protection of the German Empire. We do not necessarily have to rule them directly; after all, our initial involvement was to hinder French expansion. Granting them protectorate status would align with the Kaiser's previous declarations supporting the Sultan's sovereignty."
ww1_morocco.19.a: "The German Empire can afford to be generous."
ww1_morocco.19.b: "They will be brought under direct rule."

ww1_morocco.20.t: "Spanish Protectorate in Morocco Established"
ww1_morocco.20.d: "With the Agadir Crisis settled, France has agreed to divide Morocco into two separate protectorates. We will now administer the northern territories, securing our interests in the region."
ww1_morocco.20.a: "A toast to our French friends!"

ww1_morocco.21.t: "Sultan Yusef Dies"
ww1_morocco.21.d: "Sultan Yusef's reign has come to an abrupt end due to a sudden case of uremia. His son, Muhammad bin Yusef, has been named his successor. The late Sultan has been buried in the royal necropolis of the Moulay Abdallah Mosque."
ww1_morocco.21.a: "Long live the Sultan!"

ww1_morocco.22.t: "The International Zone of Tangier"
ww1_morocco.22.d: "Given the strategic importance of Tangier to several European powers, long discussions have concluded with the decision to establish an international zone. This compromise will hopefully ensure peace and stability in the region."
ww1_morocco.22.a: "A reasonable outcome."

ww1_morocco.23.t: "Crisis Brews in Morocco"
ww1_morocco.23.d: "At the request of the besieged Moroccan Sultan, French forces have intervened to crush a rebellion near Fez. With the rebels scattered, France is moving to solidify its control over the nation, effectively annexing it as a protectorate.\n\nThis unilateral action has shattered the agreements of the Algeciras Conference. The international community now fears the German response. It is likely the Kaiser will react forcefully to assert German interests, potentially by demanding compensation. The capitals of Europe watch and wait, as the situation could easily escalate into a wider crisis."
ww1_morocco.23.a: "Our control is non-negotiable."
ww1_morocco.23.b: "What of the Algeciras Conference?"
ww1_morocco.23.c: "Europe watches and waits."
ww1_morocco.23.e: "So, the French wish to test our resolve..."
ww1_morocco.23.f: "An excellent opportunity for [SPR.GetNameDef]!"

ww1_morocco.24.t: "Germany Backs Down"
ww1_morocco.24.d: "After [FRA.GetNameDefCap] moved to annex Morocco, the German Empire stationed the gunboat SMS Berlin in Agadir in an attempt to force concessions. The move backfired spectacularly, causing a financial panic in [GER.GetNameDef]. The stock market plummeted and the Reichsbank lost a fifth of its gold reserves.\n\nTo prevent a total collapse, the Kaiser's government has been forced into a humiliating withdrawal, recalling the SMS Berlin from Agadir. For [FRA.GetNameDef], this is a stroke of luck, but [GER.GetNameDef] will now be forced to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis and salvage what little prestige they have left."
ww1_morocco.24.a: "Surely their demands will be modest now."
ww1_morocco.24.b: "Perhaps we should publicly support the French position."

ww1_morocco.25.t: "A speech in Mansion House"
ww1_morocco.25.d.forcongo: "Earlier this week two things have come to the prime minister's attention, firstly, Germany has sent demands to France as a reaction to the crisis in Agadir which our foreign minister, Edward Grey, has informed him that they largely consist of German gains in the French Congo. The second matter, also related to the Agadir crisis, is a request from the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George - he wants to announce in a speech at Mansion House in London, to members of parliament, that our position in Agadir is one that would be of one that would support France. Whilst this would not be said directly, Lloyd George would use the fact that Germany could gain a naval port in the Atlantic should they make further demands to frighten parliament to support France.\n\nHowever, parliament would still be divided between strict neutrality, and support of the French - there have even been efforts by Edward Grey to flatter Germany due to a large minority in parliament believing that France, as the aggressor, should not receive our support. "

"
ww1_morocco.25.a: "Allow David Lloyd George to make a speech at Mansion House "
ww1_morocco.25.b: "The PM follows a policy of neutrality "

ww1_morocco.26.t: "The Agadir Negotiations"
ww1_morocco.26.d: "The deployment of our gunboat to Agadir has become a diplomatic embarrassment. The expected concessions have not materialised, and a financial panic has weakened our negotiating position. In order to salvage national prestige, the Kaiser insists that we open direct negotiations with [FRA.GetNameDef] to gain colonial territory, as was initially suggested by their government.\n\nBefore we extend an offer, however, we must determine our goals. The Foreign Office consensus is to trade our claims in Morocco for the entirety of the French Congo. Yet, other voices propose more ambitious aims: we could demand southern Morocco for ourselves, insist on a complete French withdrawal, or simply settle for financial reparations to cover our expenses. We must decide what price [FRA.GetNameDef] must pay for Morocco."
ww1_morocco.26.a: "Our price is the French Congo."
ww1_morocco.26.b: "Demand southern Morocco."
ww1_morocco.26.c: "[FRA.GetNameDefCap] must withdraw from Morocco entirely."
ww1_morocco.26.e: "Settle for financial reparations."
ww1_morocco.26.f: "Cut our losses and withdraw."

ww1_morocco.27.t: "A crisis averted "
ww1_morocco.27.d: "Much to the confusion of many diplomats, the German Empire has not reacted to the events in Morocco, seemingly avoiding a colonial crisis. The crisis in Agadir was sure to signify that war in Europe was inevitable, but with this radical change in policy from Germany, perhaps Europe may see peace yet? Alas, the United Kingdom criticised the French for their antagonistic policy, highlighting the UK's lack of commitment to their agreements to the Entente...\n\n "
ww1_morocco.27.a: "Peace in Europe"

ww1_morocco.28.t: "Germany Occupy Southern Morocco"
ww1_morocco.28.d: "Germany now occupy southern Morocco, lowering the tension in the region with a mutual agreement."
ww1_morocco.28.a: "Good"

ww1_morocco.29.t: "Rebellion Defeated"
ww1_morocco.29.d: "The army managed to stop a large part of the insurgent forces. The few remaining opponents are isolated and entrenched partisans in the Fez region, where we will have to intervene more in depth to obtain a total victory. Nevertheless, Morocco has been generally pacified and the establishment of a protectorate now seems possible."
ww1_morocco.29.a: "Good"

ww1_morocco.30.t: "France Remain Defiant"
ww1_morocco.30.d: "France has not responded to our legitimate requests. War seems inevitable and avoiding it would be seen as a huge act of weakness on our part."
ww1_morocco.30.a: "Then its war"

ww1_morocco.31.t: "France Defeated"
ww1_morocco.31.d: "French forces have called for a ceasefire, recognizing that the war in North Africa is not working to their advantage. Indeed, the Moroccan army entered Algeria and the great French colonial power was ridiculed. From now on, we can ask for generous compensation in exchange for this long-awaited peace."
ww1_morocco.31.a: "They might compensate us greatly."

ww1_morocco.32.t: "France Leave Morocco"
ww1_morocco.32.d: "French forces have called for a ceasefire, recognizing that the war in North Africa is not working to their advantage. Our fierce resistance forced the government of [FRA.GetLeader] to recognize our self-determination and thus decided to leave Morocco permanently."
ww1_morocco.32.a: "We survived!"

ww1_morocco.33.t: "France Defeated in Morocco"
ww1_morocco.33.d: "The French military intervention in Morocco did not bear these fruits. Sultan Yusef, having requested help from Paris to put down rebellions around Fez, was unable to rally his people, provoking a large uprising that the French themselves were unable to put down. Despite a special military operation with ample resources, France was unable to defeat rebellious Morocco."
ww1_morocco.33.a: "Grhhh..."
ww1_morocco.33.b: "We didnt even had to intervene!"
ww1_morocco.33.c: "What a shame for France."
ww1_morocco.33.e: "Is France THAT weak ?"
ww1_morocco.33.f: "We should be careful with our colonies in Morocco..."

ww1_morocco.34.t: "Morocco Reclaims our Colonies"
ww1_morocco.34.d: "Morocco, recently freed from all French influence, turned to us asking for the restitution of the colonies that we installed on their territory. Accepting such a proposal would be a clear loss of prestige, but knowing that a notable power like France did not obtain victory questions Morocco's abilities to fight large colonial empires."
ww1_morocco.34.a: "We should accept..."
ww1_morocco.34.b: "We wont step down!"

ww1_morocco.35.t: "[FROM.getName] Refuses"
ww1_morocco.35.d: "The [FROM.getAdjective] government has not been receptive to our demands, underestimating our ability to fight to recover our lands."
ww1_morocco.35.a: "Noted."

ww1_morocco.36.t: "[FROM.getName] Accepts!"
ww1_morocco.36.d: "The [FROM.getAdjective] government has been receptive to our requests. The local authorities have already started the administrative handover and our international prestige has been restored!"
ww1_morocco.36.a: "Noted."

ww1_morocco.38.t: "[FROM.getName] Asks for a Loan"
ww1_morocco.38.d: "Plunged into a deep economic crisis, Morocco has officially sent us a request for debt support. The sultanate is no longer able to pay the IFC, nor to invest in the country, which paralyzes their economy. Our interests in Morocco push us to accept such a request, because it will allow us to increase our influence on the country."
ww1_morocco.38.a: "Give them 100 millions francs"
ww1_morocco.38.b: "Weakening Morocco is our real objective"

ww1_morocco.39.t: "[FROM.getAdjective] Government Accepted!"
ww1_morocco.39.d: "The minister [FROM.getLeader] agreed to grant us a loan of 100 million gold francs in exchange for the concession of our customs service, which was a predictable request from the [FROM.getAdjective] authorities."
ww1_morocco.39.a: "Its better than nothing"

ww1_morocco.40.t: "[FROM.getAdjective] Government Refused!"
ww1_morocco.40.d: "Despite sending talented negotiators, France refused to grant us a loan or any aid. Not only were we humiliated by asking them to take over our debt, but we also got nothing."
ww1_morocco.40.a: "Damn..."

ww1_morocco.41.t: "\"Darija\" Tertib"
ww1_morocco.41.d: "The tertib is a form of tax intended to replace the Islamic taxes Zakkat and Achour. These ancient tributes date from the Middle Ages and had a sacred character consistent with Islam. It was therefore only with the support of the Caids and the entire Makhzen that the Sultan was able to carry out such a reform.\n\n This tertib is more egalitarian and removes the local caids from his perception. It is a kind of tax on the arable land, livestock and fruit trees of each household which eliminates the canonical taxes that the subject populations agree to pay to the Sultan."
ww1_morocco.41.a: "The best for everyone"

ww1_morocco.42.t: "Famine Hits Countryside"
ww1_morocco.42.d: "A great famine affects the Sahel due to poor harvests. This ordeal also affects our most rural regions, which risks further weakening our position."
ww1_morocco.42.a: "We cant do anything about it..."

ww1_morocco.43.t: "Excavation Concession Question"
ww1_morocco.43.d: "Morocco is not in a position to launch a prospecting mission with the current economic crisis. If we want to exploit our soil, we must turn to foreign players. Initial surveys indicate that the French and Germans are interested in carrying out research missions, in exchange for industrial exploitation rights. We could accept both partners, or only accept one, at the risk of slowing down our economy even further."
ww1_morocco.43.a: "Accept both missions"
ww1_morocco.43.b: "Accept French mission"
ww1_morocco.43.c: "Accept German mission"

ww1_morocco.44.t: "Fierce Opposition to Centralization Reform"
ww1_morocco.44.d: "The major tax reform ordered by [MOR.getLeader] and led by the El Mokri and Glaoui families has caused the exacerbation of tensions across the country, more particularly in the surrounding areas of Fez and Meknes. Already outraged by the excesses but also the failure of the military reform introduced by the Sultan in 1910, the Amazigh and Arab tribes of these two regions take a dim view of the exactions and abuses inflicted on them by Thami El Glaoui during the collection of taxes.\n\nThe situation becomes all the more untenable as the exactions committed by Glaoui's agents take on alarming proportions, not even sparing the tribes which were once exempted from paying taxes due to their status as suppliers of soldiers to the sultan's army, as was the case with the Cherarda tribe."
ww1_morocco.44.a: "Let them strike!"
ww1_morocco.44.b: "Suspend the reform"

ww1_morocco.45.t: "Financing the Reform"
ww1_morocco.45.d: "The military reform proposed by [MOR.getLeader] requires significant funds that must be drawn from somewhere. We could make an amendment to the budget, but it will damage our economy. Otherwise, we can overtax the Caïds, which will have little impact on our budgetary balance."
ww1_morocco.45.a: "Tax the Caïds"
ww1_morocco.45.b: "Amend the Budget"

ww1_morocco.46.t: "Caïds Opposes the new Taxes"
ww1_morocco.46.d: "The new tax implemented as part of the military reform project does not please the rural regions of the Anti-Atlas and Sousse in general. The local Caïds refuse to enter the country and show great distrust towards the authority of the Sultan. This lack of funds prevents the reform from being financed and therefore from being applied. Armed prospectors were sent with the support of the Glaoua family."
ww1_morocco.46.a: "We need money!"

ww1_morocco.49.t: "Successful Army Reform"
ww1_morocco.49.d: "The reform of the Sultan's army went well. It caused a major financial drain, but the Caïds were reassured that they had not been overtaxed. The new forces, trained by French, British, and Italian officers, were now prepared for modern conflicts and to protect Morocco."
ww1_morocco.49.a: "Excellent!"

ww1_morocco.50.t: "Izayan Loyalty Question"
ww1_morocco.50.d: "Middle Atlas Moutains are populated by several tributes of feared fighters. The latter all applied a transit tax to goods and enjoyed a great deal of autonomy before the [MOR.getLeader] reforms. Today, a large part of them, including the Mohas, Hemmous and the Izayans, are waging a hidden war against the central authority. They refuse to pay taxes and hide in the mountains, attacking convoys.\n\nTo reestablish the loyalty of these clans, Caïd Thami Aglaou of Marrakech was sent to talk to find out the demands of the local tributes.\n\nThe conditions for renewing their allegiance are simple: The authorization to levy a Nzala tax despite the recent regulation, but also the sacralization of their autonomy in the region. We could accept and enjoy their support, or simply stabilize the situation so that they do not rebel against our authority."
ww1_morocco.50.a: "Grant them what they want"
ww1_morocco.50.b: "We dont need them, maintain cordial relations"

ww1_morocco.51.t: "Call to Chaouia Caïds"
ww1_morocco.51.d: "The rich and fertile region of Chaouia, close to Casablanca, has always been a coveted place of power. Our reform of the army, the regained influence of the Makhzen and the French interventions from 1907 to 1909 helped ensure the loyalty of these powerful Caids. In short, we had no trouble mobilizing them, even if they were seriously lacking in equipment..."
ww1_morocco.51.a: "They will serve us well!"

ww1_morocco.52.t: "High-Sous Arbitrage"
ww1_morocco.52.d: "Since the spring of 1910, the Marrakech region has been plunged into a conflict of influence and loyalty which threatens the stability of the entire Souss. Pasha Thami Aglaou fails to control his local lords, powerful Caids from the Haida and Mouais tribes. This situation causes the cessation of the collection of taxes, attacks on convoys and a constant defiance of the central authority.\n\nThis resistance to Pasha is not unfounded, the insurgent tribes were motivated by Taïeb el Goundafi, a pretender to the title of Pasha, under the pretext that Thami Aglaou would benefit his tribe, the Igliouas, to the detriment of local order, which would be a case of corruption proven.\n\nThe Aglaou family has always been loyal to the central authority, but we could give el Goundafi a chance by taking his testimony and that of the insurgents as the strict truth."

ww1_morocco.52.b: "Appoint Taïeb el Goundafi as pacha of Marrakech"

ww1_morocco.53.t: "Self-Determination in Extreme-Sous and Atlas"
ww1_morocco.53.d: "The south of the country, dominated by the Atlas Mountains, is difficult to access, which left local tributes in almost total autonomy for several centuries. The unification of Morocco was completed in 1882 with the annexation of the autonomous territory of Sidi Hachim by Moulay Hassan I. Since then, the influence of central power has declined, in particular because of the economic crisis and the internal battle for control of the Sultanate.\n\nThis delicate situation has revived local independence, particularly in the Sub-Extreme, with memories of the prosperous kingdom of Tazeroualt returning to local discourse. In order to calm things down, we could grant relative autonomy in these regions, also in the High Atlas. Otherwise, we could authorize Sidi Mohamed to take control of the historic region of Tazeroualt in order to rebuild a kingdom there that would be submissive and faithful to us."
ww1_morocco.53.a: "Give them increased autonomy"
ww1_morocco.53.b: "Let's trust Sidi Mohamed"

ww1_morocco.54.t: "Jihad Sultan"
ww1_morocco.54.d: "During a meeting of Viziers and Caïds, the Sultan [MOR.getLeader] reaffirmed his desire not to fall under the control of the French, he thus outlined a plan aimed at stabilizing the country and making it neutral from any external influence. The speech is nuanced, it does not completely exclude foreign investments, but intends to limit and condition them. The country's policy would therefore be more pragmatic, in particular thanks to the economic development of the southern regions.\n\nThis intervention, coupled with the relatively well-prepared reform on the army, gives hope to the administrators of the Sous and the Atlas, who hope to receive funding and recognition of their autonomy."
ww1_morocco.54.a: "We will reform the country"

ww1_morocco.55.t: "Treaty of Fès"
ww1_morocco.55.d: "The Sultan [MOR.getLeader] signed a protectorate agreement with France, subjugating Morocco which lost much of its sovereignty. This treaty follows a series of social, economic and military crises that the Cherifian empire was unable to confront with the constant assistance of France.\n\nDejected and submissive, Morocco has since then only enjoyed a facade of independence, which is definitively erased by the signing of this agreement."

ww1_morocco.56.d: "[MOR.getLeader] announced that he would abdicate his title of Sultan, torn by remorse and the weight of the dissolution of Morocco's independence under his reign. After a series of failed reforms and total Francophile subjugation, the Sultan admitted his incompetence, threatening suicide if he was not allowed to leave the throne.\n\nThe line of succession is very clear, his successor is his brother: Moulay Youssef."

ww1_morocco.57.t: "Ahmed al-Hiba Rebellion"
ww1_morocco.57.d: "The signing of the Treaty of Fez was a significant subject of revolt within Morocco. The loss of sovereignty of the Sultan, himself who considered himself anti-French, was perceived as a great betrayal among the tribes. In the south, many clans rose up by mutual agreement, bringing together the peoples of Tiznit, Tafraout, Taroudant, the anti Atlas, the Atlas... In short, the south of the entire country.\n\nThis improbable coalition is led by several influential warlords like Si Madani or Addi Ou Ahmed. These troops are working to overthrow the sultan [MOR.getLeader] and replace him with Ahmed al-Hiba, a Moorish religious leader recognized as Sultan by the tributes allied in Marrakech.\n\nThis situation is difficult, it is a real reconquest operation that will have to be carried out in the mountains and Sousse."

ww1_morocco.60.d: "We received a letter from [MOR.getLeader] of Morocco, who contacted us to express their good wishes, but also to address more tense issues. The document addresses the significant tensions of the last 15 years in Morocco, while praising our country's contribution in ensuring their neutrality.\n\nThe tone of the communiqué is generally friendly, inviting us to take advantage of the weakening of French influence to relaunch our investments, but also a more active diplomacy in the region."

ww1_morocco.63.d: "We received a letter from [MOR.getLeader] discussing Franco-Moroccan relations. He was very kind and informed us of the stabilization of the rural countryside, stating that French and foreign interests in Morocco were now guaranteed by the recently reformed Moroccan army.\n\nThey came to the point a few paragraphs later, stating that due to the delay in stability in Morocco, French occupation was no longer necessary. They therefore politely requested the departure of our army and an end to the occupation of Casablanca and the other territories under our control.\n\nSuch a maneuver would pull the rug out from under our feet in the country, permanently destroying our privileged position in the region."

ww1_morocco.65.d: "After tense diplomatic exchanges, the French authorities presented a compromise, stating that the occupation of Morocco had cost them a huge amount of money. They therefore agreed to leave on the condition that we pay their army for the services rendered, to the tune of 87 million francs, which represents a fortune for our economy."

ww1_morocco.68.t: "Failure of Casablanca Agreements"
ww1_morocco.68.d: "Despite the efforts of our diplomats, we have failed to convince the French to leave the occupied areas of Morocco. This deadlock is pushing us to consider alternative solutions. We could confront France, but it is highly likely that we would be crushed alone. We must secure the support of a neighboring great power to ensure recognition of our claims and military guarantees.\n\nHowever, alignment on this issue is not easy to achieve, and we may need to make concessions to the great power that deigns to open its doors to us. The risks are significant—enough to consider halting the escalation right here."

Seeking to free itself from French influence, Morocco has found itself in an impasse, unable to force the occupier to leave. They are therefore asking us for political and military support designed to force France to yield.\n\nIn exchange, they are offering us the inalienable preservation of our interests, as well as a mutual defensive guarantee. Accepting such a proposal could provoke a war with the Entente, but could also set France back in Africa."

ww1_morocco.70.d: "Tensions are rising in the Atlas Mountains after the Moroccan government requested the withdrawal of French troops from Casablanca. France refused these demands, judging that Morocco was unable to guarantee the security of French and allied economic interests in the region.\n\nThis sticking point has prompted a rapprochement between the Moroccan and German governments, which met in Berlin yesterday. In addition to providing political support, the Reich also announced a potential military agreement aimed at guaranteeing Morocco's sovereignty against France."

ww1_morocco.71.d: "Our delegation sealed a German-Moroccan rapprochement, greatly increasing the weight of our demands. From now on, France will have to reconsider its proposals and initiate a de-escalation, or risk provoking a war with the world's most powerful empire."

ww1_morocco.72.d: "The rapprochement between Morocco and the Reich does not bode well for our military occupation of the Souss.

ww1_austriahungary.14.d: "As tensions with Russia rises over instability in the Balkans, particularly in Albania, [AUS.GetLeader] has approved a series of new trade restrictions with Russia to attempt to economically punish Russia for its actions in the Balkans, hoping to use the trade restrictions as leverage later.

Still, issues remain as Czech nationalist parties seek greater autonomy, while German nationalist parties attempt to agitate the situation. Czechoslovak labor unions are also organizing in an attempt to extract greater concessions from us. Bienerth has seeked to further stabilize the situation by passing a series of reforms across the Cisleithanian half of the empire to appease Czechoslovaks, Romanians, Poles, and Ruthenians."

ww1_austriahungary.13.t: "Livestock Exports Fall"
ww1_austriahungary.13.d: "The disease issue seems to be here to stay, with rinderpest recking havok on the agricultural industry and our major trading partners temporarily suspending many of our exports. It's gotten to the point where a government response is needed to help eradicate disease and revive our exports."
ww1_austriahungary.13.a: "Our intervention is needed"
ww1_austriahungary.10.t: "Sucessful Alispan Reform in Hungary"
ww1_austriahungary.10.d: "The Hungarian government has offically removed several ineffective Alispans from office and agreed to pursue government reforms to make their government more efficient. Although not ground breaking, we can expect these actions to help improve our empire's government efficiency."
ww1_austriahungary.10.a: "Great!"
ww1_austriahungary.9.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Agrees to Leave the Situation to Us"
ww1_austriahungary.9.d: "Our objections to [AUS.GetLeader] over Austria's move to fire several Alispans has lead to him to agree to let us handle the situation ourselves, meaning he expects us to launch our own investigations to improve the efficiency of our government, yet he will not force it on us."

ww1_austriahungary.6.d: "The parliament of the Austrian-half of the empire has approved a motion with [AUS.GetLeader]'s endorsement to fire several ineffective local leaders and implement local government reforms at the Varmegyek level. Although we have no legal authority to overturn the kings decision, we could lobby a protest to try and convince [AUS.GetLeader] to reconsider the move, which has brought anger from Hungarian nationalists who see it as Austrian overreach. We could also simply do nothing."

ww1_austriahungary.6.b: "That's such an overreach!"

ww1_austriahungary.7.d: "Our attempts to reorganize several local Hungarian governments has been met with objection by [HUN.GetLeader], who's claimed that the move would be an overreach despite it unquestionably being legal. Still, going foward with the move may strengthen the support of Hungarian nationalists who could use the incident to claim we are not respecting Hungarias rights to independent governance. What should we do?"
ww1_austriahungary.7.a: "This was a completely legal move, give it the go-ahead"
ww1_austriahungary.7.b: "Well we suppose it could be shelved..."

ww1_austriahungary.2.d: "Kaiser [AUS.GetLeader] has appointed Stephan Burián von Rajecz as Minister besides the King, or 'a király személye körüli miniszter', but not without its difficulties. Many have described Stephan as intimidating, and was described as 'the type of man who listened motionless, almost glassy-eyed, without betraying the slightest expression, responding robotically in a dry, school lecture without taking a breath.' The Kaiser had to think for a long time before giving the go of putting him in office."
ww1_austriahungary.2.a: "Scary"
ww1_austriahungary.3.t: "[AUS.GetName] offers a Trade Deal"
ww1_austriahungary.3.d: "The [AUS.GetAdjectiveCap]s have invited us to a trade convention where they discussed a draft for a trade deal, where we would get more resources for each other."

HUN_aftermath_of_werkle_desc: "In 1905, King Jozsef decided to dissolve parliment, due to the failure of the 1st Tisza government and the current impasse in parliment. The King called for new elections, expecting the iberal Party to continue its 30 year ruling; however, to everyone's suprise the allied-opposition defeated the liberals. The allied opposition that won was the coalition of Independence and Forty-Eight Party (F48P). The 48P opposed the Dual Compromise of 1867 and advocated for the goals of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parlimentary majority, appointed a trong-dualist. This government was shortlived and Sandor Werkle succeded as a compromise. The comrpomise government got little done and was beaten by the merge of the old liberal party, into the National Party of Work."

HUN_within_the_union_desc: "The Compromise of 1867 was the result of 18 years of "passive resistance", which reestablished the Kingdom of  Hungary as an Equal partner to the Crown in Austria. This resulted in a system alled Dualism, where The Crowns have considerable separation of powers, except in some economic matters, Foreign diplomacy and most military matters. The passive resistance had some drawbacks, like stagnation in ndustrialisation and modernisation."

ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály árolyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to orm a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. owever, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the ssasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."
ww1_hungary.10.a: "End of an Era!"
ww1_hungary.11.t: "Disaster At Lemberg"
ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While lfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on o. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."

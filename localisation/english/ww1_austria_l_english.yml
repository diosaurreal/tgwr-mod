AUS_tackle_galician_poverty_desc: "Galicia has a very high poverty rate compared to the rest of the empire, which has resulted in deep resentment from the peoples living there while also trapping the region into a stagnant economy.

AUS_investing_in_galacia: "Already investing in Galicia"
AUS_state_of_the_realm: "Ausgleich Political System"
AUS_state_of_the_realm_desc: "The Habsburg crown binds together a vast multilingual patchwork of provinces and local autonomies, all with competing parliaments, seperatists, and social unrest. While through gradual reforms we can hopefully mantain a stable and prosperious empire, a national crisis could lead to the empire completely dismantling."
AUS_economic_patchwork: "Economic Patchwork"
AUS_italian_university_desc: "Despite the best efforts from irredentists in Rome, Italians have often been described as the empires most loyal minority group.

Doing so would be an easy way to gain more support from Italian locals in our empire."
AUS_economic_patchwork_desc: "The Economy of [AUS.GetNameDef] is a jumbled quilt with prosperious cities and crime ridden slums. The economy may be stable but it is very unequal, which has caused resentment amongst many."

AUS_reorganize_hungarian_governors: "Reorganize Local Hungarian Governments"
AUS_fortwursteln_desc: "A long 6 decades of rule under Franz Joseph has left the aging man tired, and perhaps not as proactive as he used to be. Still, the empire needs his service now more then ever, and as some Austrians like to say, he's 'fortwursteln', or muddling along somehow."

AUS_bohemian_admin_reform: "Reform the Bohemian Administration"

AUS_prioritize_wellbeing_of_galacia: "Prioritize the Well-Being of Galicia"
AUS_prioritize_wellbeing_of_galacia_desc: "Improving the situation in Galicia should be a top priority of the government, as if we let poverty continue to run rampant, we'll never have any hope at fully stabilizing the kingdom. We should work towards expanding government funding towards the cause."

# EVENTS 
ww1_austriahungary.10.t: "Sucessful Alispan Reform in Hungary"
ww1_austriahungary.10.d: "The Hungarian government has offically removed several ineffective Alispans from office and agreed to pursue government reforms to make their government more efficient. Although not ground breaking, we can expect these actions to help improve our empire's government efficiency."
ww1_austriahungary.10.a: "Great!"
ww1_austriahungary.9.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Agrees to Leave the Situation to us"
ww1_austriahungary.9.d: "Our objections to [AUS.GetLeader] over Austria's move to fire several Alispans has lead to him to agree to let us handle the situation ourselves, meaning he expects us to launch our own investigations to improve the efficiency of government, yet will not force it on us."
ww1_austriahungary.9.a: "Glad we resolved that"
ww1_austriahungary.8.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Ignores Our Concerns"
ww1_austriahungary.8.d: "Despite our attempts to stop it, several Hungarian Alispan's have been fired in an Austrian move to make the empire's governments more effective. No matter how effective this may be, it clearly wasn't right for them to do it without our permission. Still, what's done is done, and we must move on."
ww1_austriahungary.8.a: "Do they even respect us?"
ww1_austriahungary.6.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Moves to Fire Several Alispan's"
ww1_austriahungary.6.d: "The parliament of the Austrian half of the empire has approved a motion with [AUS.GetLeader]'s endorsement to fire several ineffective local leaders and implement local government reforms at the Varmegyek level. Although we have no legal authority to overturn the kings decision, we could lobby a protest to try and convince [AUS.GetLeader] to reconsider the move, which has brought anger from Hungarian nationalists who see it as Austrian overreach. We could also simply do nothing."
ww1_austriahungary.6.a: "There's no problem here"
ww1_austriahungary.6.b: "That's such an overreach!"
ww1_austriahungary.7.t: "[HUN.GetLeader] Objects to our Attempt to Dismiss Several Alispan's"
ww1_austriahungary.7.d: "Our attempts to reorganize several local Hungarian governments has been met with objection by [HUN.GetLeader], who's claimed that the move would be an overreach despite it unquestionably being legal. Still, going foward with the move may strengthen the support of Hungarian nationalists who could use the incident to claim we are not respecting Hungarias rights to independent governance. What should we do?"
ww1_austriahungary.7.a: "This was a completely legal move, give it the go-ahead"
ww1_austriahungary.7.b: "Well I suppose we could shelf it..."
ww1_austriahungary.1.t: "Minister of Finance resigns"

ww1_austriahungary.1.a: "Ok"
ww1_austriahungary.2.t: "New Foreign Minister Appointed"
ww1_austriahungary.2.d: "Kaiser [AUS.GetLeader] has appointed Stephan Burián von Rajecz as Minister besides the King, or 'a király személye körüli miniszter', but not without its difficulties. Many have described Stephan as intimidating, and was described as 'the type of man who listened motionless, almost glassy-eyed, without betraying the slightest expression, responding robotically in a dry, school lecture without taking a breath.' The Kaiser had to think for a long time before giving the go of putting him in office."
ww1_austriahungary.2.a: "Scary"
ww1_austriahungary.3.t: "[AUS.GetName] offers a Trade Deal"

AUH_stitching_the_quilt_desc: "The Cisleithania half of the empire is full of Italians, Romanians, Bohemians, Poles, and Ukranians, all with their own interests and issues important to them.

We need to work towards compromising with minority interest groups and adressing the economic inequality in the empire in order to secure a stable future."

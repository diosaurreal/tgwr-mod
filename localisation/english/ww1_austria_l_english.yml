ww1_austriahungary.42.d: "As elections get closer and closer, defining the narritive is becoming increasingly important for the three major parties. Conservatives are attempting to frame the election through social and religious issues, rallying Christians to their side, liberals are claiming they have the solutions to institutional problems that Austria faces, and social democrats are promising to fight for the common people."

ww1_austriahungary.41.d: "As the liberal-nationalist coalition looks to have a good shot at winning a majority next election, some Czech nationalists are considering flipping their vote from local Bohemian nationalist political parties to the 'Deutscher Nationalverband'. Because the local parties have no chance at winning a majority in parliament, a vote for them could arguably be a waste, compared to voting for Deutscher Nationalverband, which may actually win. A Deutscher Nationalverband majority would be much more preferable to a Christian Social party majority, after all."

ww1_austriahungary.35.d: "German right-wing nationalism has been on the steady decline in Austria, usually performing quite poorly in elections. With the monarchy generally opposing all forms of nationalism, including German nationalism, they've felt ostracized from the politics of the politics of the Christian Social Party, the largest right-wing party in Austria, which is closely aligned with the Habsburg Crown. The liberals in recent years have been forming coalitions with some German nationalists, yet these German nationalists are usually not right-wing at all, instead agreeing with most of the ideas of the liberals. Small in numbers, right-wing German nationalists know they'd airball at gaining a substantial number of seats in parliament, yet their group is large enough that throwing the towel behind one party could help boost it, and increase their leverage within the party. The question is what party to go with."

With elections upcoming in Austria, many in the SAO wish to employ the SPD's help.

It's a move nobody in the government is seriously considering, yet Aehrenthal, our top diplomat, has taken particular offense to the suggestion. He has claimed for some time now that having such an aggressive and impulsive man such as Conrad in charge of the army is undermining his diplomacy efforts with Austria's neighbors, with his words condradicting what is supposed to be the Austrian states offical position of wanting peace, friendly relations, and stability across the world. Although [AUS.GetLeader] has excused a lot of Hotzendorf's inflammatory statements in the past, this incident combined with the pressure from Aehrenthal has lead to [AUS.GetLeader] to temporarily suspend Hotzendorf's position as head of the army."

ww1_austriahungary.47.d: "A couple months ago, we have applied the principle of protectionism and have placed protective tariffs on produce like cattle and grain from other countries in order to benefit Galician and Hungarian farmers. The cattle tariffs have proven to be efficient, with foreign cattle prices rising over 30% and making Imperial farmers in Galicia and Transylvania making much bank. Unfortunately, the wheat tariffs have been uneffective as we have been unable to outmatch foreign wheat production."

They claim Galicia's economy relies heavily on railway transport used for exporting grain, salt, and oil. If the Danube canal system was improved, trade would increasingly shift to waterways, bypassing Galician railways and destroying their economy. They're currently using parliamenary procedure laws to block the projects from getting funding, though [AUS.GetLeader] can use a royal decree to bypass their concerns if needed."

The King called for new elections, expecting the iberal Party to continue its 30 year ruling; however, to everyone's suprise the allied-opposition defeated the liberals. The allied opposition that won was the coalition of Independence and Forty-Eight Party (F48P). The 48P opposed the Dual Compromise of 1867 and advocated for the goals of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parlimentary majority, appointed a trong-dualist. This government was shortlived and Sandor Werkle succeded as a compromise.

### EVENTS
ww1_austriahungary.20.t: "Meat Shortges Collapse Support for Incumbent Parties"
ww1_austriahungary.20.d: "As the Austrian half of the empire prepares for new elections, the recent meat shortages are leading to anti incumbent backlash. Currently, Austria is dominated by the Christian Social Party, yet a coalition of liberals and nationalists now seem poised to break the Christian Social Parties dominance over Austrian politics."
ww1_austriahungary.20.a: "The emperor is the one who holds the real power!"
ww1_austriahungary.19.t: "Organized Labour Shows Signs of Division"
ww1_austriahungary.19.d: "Organized labor, strongest in the industrial regions of Bohemia and inner Austria, have enjoyed moderate cohesion in the past united in an effort to improve workers conditions for all. With elections upcoming, fractures between the movement are beginning to show. Labor unions aligned with Czech nationalist and German nationalist organizations are struggling to cooperate, seeing eachother as enemies instead of comrades united behind the struggle for better working conditions."
ww1_austriahungary.19.a: "We need to exploit this as much as possible!"
ww1_austriahungary.19.b: "Well that's interesting"
ww1_austriahungary.18.t: "Livestock Disease Crisis Effects Supply Chains"
ww1_austriahungary.18.d: "The beginning of the disease problem amongst much of our cattle has reduced our trade with other countries and hurt our own meat production. Now, with all of the pre-disease meat supply being sold in shops, supply chains across the country are offically being hit, quite hard. The price of meat has soared, with many shops reporting shortages."
ww1_austriahungary.18.a: "We'll have to weather this storm"
ww1_austriahungary.15.t: "Increasing Imports from Serbia"
ww1_austriahungary.15.d: "While we wait for the livestock issue to figure itself out, many in the government think increasing imports from Serbia temporarily could help prevent dramatic price rises. The problem, however, is that Hungaries aggressive anti Slav policies have dramatically strained relations between us and Serbia, and seeing our vulnerability right now, they're not likely to accept a new trade deal without Hungary reforming their treatment of Slavs in Croatia. Thus, we plan to offically request Hungary reform their treatment of slavs, so we can secure a trade deal with Serbia."
ww1_austriahungary.15.a: "It's embarrassing, but we need this"
ww1_austriahungary.16.t: "Austria Requests we Reform Anti-Serb Policies"
ww1_austriahungary.16.d: "Seeing the recent issues in our agricultural industry caused by livestock diseases, Austria is seeking to increase Serbian agricultural imports temporarily to prevent food shortages. However, our anti Serb policies in both trade and treatment of slavic citizens has lead Serbia to have zero interests in increasing trade with either us or Austria. Thus, Austria is requesting we make reforms so that trade with Serbia can be increased."
ww1_austriahungary.16.a: "Yeah, fat chance!"
ww1_austriahungary.17.t: "Hungary Refuses to Ammend Anti-Serb Policies"
ww1_austriahungary.17.d: "The arrogant Hungarians have refused to reform their treatment of Slavs on their lands, effectively killing our idea of increasing Serbian imports to help alievate a food crisis. This, combined with recent trade restrictions on Russia, means that our ability to avoid a temporary food shortage is reliant on us having good luck."
ww1_austriahungary.17.a: "Damn Hungarians"
ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály árolyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to orm a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. owever, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the ssasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."

ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While lfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on o. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."

ww1_hungary.12.d: "The Hungarian prime minister Károly Khuen-Héderváry has been passing laws that favor the Serbs living in Vojvodina, to the great dissapointment of every Croat nationalists. Khuen-Héderváry has had a past of 'Serbophile' accusations, ever since becoming the Croatian Ban in 1883. He would remain in this position until 1903, where he would agitate the Croatians by passing acts and bills that favored the Serbs and undermining the Croatian Authority. None-theless Khuen-Héderváry has proven to be very reliable and one of the Dual Monarchy's foremost champions. We must trust in his methods."

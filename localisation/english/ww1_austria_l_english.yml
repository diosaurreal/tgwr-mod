The rest of the description is a wikipedia copy paste. Here we go! In the wake of fighting between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary and the subsequent two decades of uneasy co-existence, Hungarian troops served either in ethnically mixed units or were stationed away from Hungarian regions. With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Austro-Hungarian Army was brought into being. It existed until the disestablishment of Austria-Hungary in 1918 following the end of World War I. Common Army units were generally poorly trained and had very limited access to new equipment, because the governments of the Austrian and Hungarian parts of the empire often preferred to generously fund their own units instead of outfitting all three army branches equally."

ww1_austriahungary.77.t: "An Active Empire"
ww1_austriahungary.77.d: "As an empire with 2 sovereign halves, both with their own complicated governments, political issues, and societal tensions, the Austro-Hungarian empire certainly doesn't bore those who govern it, to say the least. To ensure the empire prospers into the next decades, we'll need pay attention carefully."
ww1_austriahungary.77.a: "We will get it done!"
ww1_bosnia.2.t: "Concerning Growth of Young Bosnia"
ww1_bosnia.2.d: "Many schools and universities across Bosnia have began to see more political oppositionist agitation coming from a new group called the Mlada Bosna, or the Young Bosnia party. Popular among students, this group is causing Bosnian-nationalist agitation and is spreading cancer beliefs like seperating from the Austro-Hungarian condominium, igniting a revolution to break free from Austrian chains and even uniting with independent Balkan-slavic nations like Serbia."

ww1_austriahungary.42.t: "Defining the Narrative"
ww1_austriahungary.42.d: "As elections get closer and closer, defining the narritive is becoming increasingly important for the three major parties. Conservatives are attempting to frame the election through social and religious issues, rallying Christians to their side, liberals are claiming they have the solutions to institutional problems that Austria faces, and social democrats are promising to fight for the common people."
ww1_austriahungary.42.a: "We need to secure the moral fabric of our country"

ww1_austriahungary.42.c: "We need a government that provides for the people!"
ww1_austriahungary.41.d: "As the liberal-nationalist coalition looks to have a good shot at winning a majority next election, some Czech nationalists are considering flipping their vote from local Bohemian nationalist political parties to the 'Deutscher Nationalverband'. Because the local parties have no chance at winning a majority in parliament, a vote for them could arguably be a waste, compared to voting for Deutscher Nationalverband, which may actually win. A Deutscher Nationalverband majority would be much more preferable to a Christian Social party majority, after all."
ww1_austriahungary.41.a: "They're absolutely right"
ww1_austriahungary.41.b: "Nonsense, the Deutscher Nationalverband is mostly a German nationalist group"
ww1_austriahungary.40.d: "The SAO, being a socialist party with its primary support being the working class, is dealing with the reality of conservative governance. The Christian Social Party is pulling back no punches when it comes to their approach to organized labor, shutting it down whenever they can. It's shattering worker cohesion, and weakening the SAO's ability to spread support through organized labor."

ww1_austriahungary.50.t: "Czech Nationalist Parties Overperform"
ww1_austriahungary.50.d: "A notable excerpt from the recent elections to the Imperial Council is the overperformance of Czech nationalist parties. The Czech block has picked up numerous seats, increasing their influence over the Imperial Council, which may lead to more pressure for the Minister-President to help come up with a suitable compromise for the various demands Czech nationalists have. "
ww1_austriahungary.50.a: "I guess we can't kick this issue down the road much longer"
ww1_austriahungary.64.t: "A Question of Priorities"
ww1_austriahungary.64.d: "The main things being smuggled into Bosnia seems to be weapons and propaganda, both having their negative effects on Bosnia. While the weapon smuggling is obviously more dangerous on the surface, indeed many attempted assassinations are failing due to poor planning. In addition, there are worries that the propaganda campaigns may stoke further unrest. We must decide what we wish for border security to focus the most on."

ww1_austriahungary.54.d: "[AUS.GetName] and their diplomats have approached us, offering us various treaties on commerce and legal assistance. Although our government is far from friendly with Austria, these treaties do seem mutually benefical and may represent a new approach Austria is taking to diplomacy. Perhaps we could all be friends? Or we could reject these approaches all together"

ww1_austriahungary.79.a: "Noted"
ww1_austriahungary.52.t: "Czechs Ramp Up Obstructionism"
ww1_austriahungary.52.d: "With the Minister-President actively tacking a stance against Czech parties, Czechs in parliament have began to intensify their obstruction. Bills not even related to education are having their votes canceled as Czechs walk out, only agreeing to votes on bills they favor. Although the Czechs are usually allowing bills to pass after large delays, its still beginning to make parliament non functional."
ww1_austriahungary.52.a: "In what world is this fair?"
ww1_austriahungary.58.t: "[MNT.GetName] Refuses Treaties"

ww1_austriahungary.58.a: "Fools."
ww1_austriahungary.53.t: "Czechs Begin Making Moves"
ww1_austriahungary.53.d: "With our explicit anti-Czech moves, Czechs in the Bohemian Diet have began making their own moves. They're testing boundries, passing several reforms aimed at achieving their demands they've failed to reach in the Imperial Council. It's leading to calls for the Minister-President to suspend the Bohemian Diet, or at least limit their authority."
ww1_austriahungary.53.a: "Is this even legal?"
ww1_austriahungary.63.t: "Spike in Black Hand and Young Bosnia Activity"
ww1_austriahungary.63.d: "The outbreak of war between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire has lead to a surge of Serbian nationalism both in Serbia and amongst Serbs in our country. This, combined with Serbian border security on our border being lower as their government prioritizes war with the Ottoman Empire, is leading to a large increase in smuggling campaigns from Serbia to Bosnia. Propaganda pieces, guns, and amunammunition are flooding into Bosnia, inflaming tensions and increasing violence in the region."
ww1_austriahungary.63.a: "A massive crackdown is needed!"
ww1_austriahungary.49.t: "The Struggle to Pass a Budget"
ww1_austriahungary.49.d: "A session to pass a new budget in the Imperial council has taken much longer then expected due to the obstruction of Czech nationalists, who clashed fiercly with the prefered budget from German nationalists. The budget was eventually passed days after it was expected to, with extensive intervention from the Minister-President needed. "
ww1_austriahungary.49.a: "Not good"
ww1_austriahungary.62.t: "Socialist Marches in Vienna"
ww1_austriahungary.62.d: "Our recent anti socialist policies have lead to socialist groups organizing marches in their strong points, particularly in Vienna. They're rallying support from workers, who see the government's policies as oppressive. Although they seem relatively harmless so far, they protests aren't a great look."
ww1_austriahungary.62.a: "A bunch of nobodies"
ww1_austriahungary.60.t: "Czechs Breakdown Reichsrat"
ww1_austriahungary.60.d: "The Czechs, previously holding back the passage of bills, have began outright refusing to let anything pass. They're dodging votes, instead giving long speeches about the importance of education reform in Bohemia. It's leading to a Reichsrat that can't function, meaning drastic measures are probably needed."
ww1_austriahungary.60.a: "They can't accept that their ideas aren't popular!"
ww1_austriahungary.51.t: "Massive Investmnents From Vienna"
ww1_austriahungary.51.d: "The Austrian government in Vienna have approved large scale investments into Bosnia, which are expected to help us construct new schools, roads, police, and help us invest in local industries."
ww1_austriahungary.51.a: "How kind of them!"

The liberals in recent years have been forming coalitions with some German nationalists, yet these German nationalists are usually not right-wing at all, instead agreeing with most of the ideas of the liberals. Small in numbers, right-wing German nationalists know they'd airball at gaining a substantial number of seats in parliament, yet their group is large enough that throwing the towel behind one party could help boost it, and increase their leverage within the party. The question is what party to go with."

ww1_austriahungary.85.d: "The outbreak of war between the Balkan League and the Ottoman Empire has lead to series of hasty negotiations between the major powers of Europe, desperately trying to prevent the war from escalating. The detected mass movement of Austro-Hungarian troops to the Serbian Border has certainly not calmed the fears of these great powers, as tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia continue to rise. It's no secret many in the Austro-Hungarian empire have seeked a pre-emptive strike against Serbia, and many worry Austria may be going down that path."
ww1_austriahungary.85.a: "We're simply preparing for anything!"
ww1_austriahungary.85.b: "God, are they going to drag us into a world war?"
ww1_austriahungary.85.c: "They wouldn't dare!"
ww1_austriahungary.81.d: "The eruption of a massive war directly southern of us requires a strong response from us. Hawkish members of the government are outright calling for a strike against Serbia, claiming war with Serbia is clearly inevitable, and we should start it on our terms, while they're still weak and distracted with their war against the Ottoman Empire. It would surely be an easily victory in theory, yet in reality it would risk Russian intervention, which would start a war between the Entente and the Triple Alliance. More pacifist members in the government think we should take a more cool-headed approach. Recognizing the chaos at the southern border, they believe we should demand Serbia sign a treaty with us to help ensure border security and help smother out smuggling operations."
ww1_austriahungary.81.a: "Serbia's actions are destroying the peace in the Balkans. We need to strongly condemn them!"
ww1_austriahungary.81.b: "Serbias actions are risking the stability of the Balkans. They need to fix this!"

ww1_austriahungary.84.t: "Mass Movement of Troops to Bosnia"
ww1_austriahungary.84.d: "The outbreak of war in the Balkans between the Balkan League and the Ottoman Empire could easily spread to us if we're not careful. With Serbian agents in Bosnia attempting to cause a revolution, we must be prepared for a possible war. By deploying a large force to Bosnia, we can ensure we're prepared for anything, and send a clear message to Serbia."

ww1_austriahungary.82.t: "Austria Demands Treaty on Border Security"
ww1_austriahungary.82.d: "The outbreak of war in the Balkans has lead to a spike of activity from Young Bosnia and the Black Hand, being whipped into a frenzy by our war of liberation in the balkans as well as having the advantage of a less secure Austrian border, as our forces focus on the war with the Ottoman Empire. It seems these groups are causing issues for Austria, who has come to our government with a demand. They are demanding we increase security on the border to try and weaken these groups."
ww1_austriahungary.82.a: "We'll agree, to prevent their wrath."
ww1_austriahungary.83.t: "Serbia Agrees to Increase Border Security"
ww1_austriahungary.83.d: "Serbia has agreed to ramp up the arrests of smugglers from their side of the Austro-Serbian border, which should help us deal with the issue. Although Serbia is still clearly an enemy country due to their actions in the balkans, this deal does open up the ability of future peaceful co-existance between our two countries."

The King called for new elections, expecting the Liberal Party to continue its 30 year ruling; however, to everyone's suprise the unified-opposition defeated the liberals. The unified opposition that won was the coalition of Independence and Forty-Eight Party (F48P). The F48P opposed the Dual Compromise of 1867 and advocated for the goals of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parlimentary majority, appointed a strong-dualist. This government was shortlived and Sandor Werkle succeded as a compromise.

### EVENTS
ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály árolyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to orm a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. owever, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the ssasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."
ww1_hungary.10.a: "End of an Era!"
ww1_hungary.11.t: "Disaster At Lemberg"
ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While lfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on o. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."
ww1_hungary.11.a: "We have to point the finger at someone"
ww1_hungary.12.t: "Hungary Meddles in Croat-Serb Relations"
ww1_hungary.12.d: "The Hungarian prime minister Károly Khuen-Héderváry has been passing laws that favor the Serbs living in Vojvodina, to the great dissapointment of every Croat nationalists. Khuen-Héderváry has had a past of 'Serbophile' accusations, ever since becoming the Croatian Ban in 1883. He would remain in this position until 1903, where he would agitate the Croatians by passing acts and bills that favored the Serbs and undermining the Croatian Authority. None-theless Khuen-Héderváry has proven to be very reliable and one of the Dual Monarchy's foremost champions. We must trust in his methods."
ww1_hungary.12.a: "He probably knows what he's doing"
ww1_hungary.13.t: "Károly Khuen-Héderváry Resigns!"
ww1_hungary.13.d: "Károly Khuen-Héderváry has been unable to break the obstructionist opposition, especially around the topic of the yearly Defense Bill. For this reason the Prime Minister is resigning, and the Minister of Finances, László Lukács is the one who taking his office as the Prime Minister. He might bring the stability this country needs."

ww1_hungary.14.d: "The time has once again come to renegotiate the Common Army funding quota. As of recent there has been fierce debate in Parliment over the army. How much should we cough up? Should Hungary also be an official command language? With turbulent times ahead we will either need stronger hearts or more army funding..."

ww1_hungary.17.d: "István Tisza has become the speaker of Hungarian Parliment. A controversial man, he has had a previous government briefly from fall of 1903 to late winter of 1904. His premiership is seen as a failure and led to the Liberal Party losing parlimentary majority for the first time in three decades. Tisza's critics are opposed to him due to his often authoritarian leadership. Tisza is also opposed to a more liberal suffrage system and often favours companies then workers; however Tisza can inspire economic growth and promote unity within the Ausgleich"

ww1_hungary.19.d: "In response to István Tisza becoming speaker of the House with the goal of breaking the opposition's obrstruction, workers have taken to the streets of Budapest calling for equal suffrage, better living conditions and the removal of Tisza.

The demonstration would end that evening after threats; however, tragically lead to many injuries, damage to local shops and transport and the death of six. Tisza and the Lukacs remain unwavered from their goals."

Despite the fierce opposition, Tisza ordered guards to forcefully remove members who dare vote in opposition or quote on quote protest, become angry or violent. Without a debate and no opinion allowed from the opposition the Defense Bill has passed. István Tisza has become a hated man in Hungarian politics, but regardless the crisis that's plagued Hungary for the last decade may finally be resolved. With the passing of the bill the annual contingent of recruits has been raised. Much to the pleasure of the King."

By the grace of god none of the shots hit. Gyula Kovács would attempt to commit suicide with the 4th shot; however, the bullet seems to have not caused any serious injury."

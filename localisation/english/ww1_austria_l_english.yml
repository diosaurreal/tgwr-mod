AUS_state_of_the_realm: "State of the Realm"
AUS_state_of_the_realm_desc: "The Habsburg crown binds together a vast multilingual patchwork of provinces and local autonomies, all with competing parliaments, seperatists, and social unrest. While through gradual reforms we can hopefully mantain a stable and prosperious empire, a national crisis could lead to the empire completely dismantling."
AUS_economic_patchwork: "Economic Patchwork"
AUS_economic_patchwork_desc: "The Economy of [AUS.GetNameDef] is a jumbled quilt with prosperious cities and crime ridden slums. The economy may be stable but it is very unequal, which has caused resentment amongst many."

AUS_fortwursteln: "Fortwursteln"
AUS_fortwursteln_desc: "A long 6 decades of rule under Franz Joseph has left the aging man tired, and perhaps not as proactive as he used to be. Still, the empire needs his service now more then ever, and as some Austrians like to say, he's 'fortwursteln', or muddling along somehow."

# EVENTS 
ww1_austriahungary.1.t: "Minister of Finance resigns"
ww1_austriahungary.1.d: "Stephan Burián von Rajecz has decided to throw in the towel as position of Reichsfinanzminister as he was finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile the various ethnic factions."
ww1_austriahungary.1.a: "Ok"
ww1_austriahungary.2.t: "New Foreign Minister Appointed"
ww1_austriahungary.2.d: "Kaiser [AUS.GetLeader] has appointed Stephan Burián von Rajecz as Minister besides the King, or 'a király személye körüli miniszter', but not without its difficulties. Many have described Stephan as intimidating, and was described as 'the type of man who listened motionless, almost glassy-eyed, without betraying the slightest expression [...] Then, he would respond robotically in a dry, school lecture without taking a breath.' The Kaiser had to think for a long time before giving the go of putting him in office."
ww1_austriahungary.2.a: "Scary"
#DECISIONS 
AUS_stitching_the_quilt: "Stitching the Quilt"
AUS_stitching_the_quilt_desc: "The Cisleithania half of the empire is full of Italians, Romanians, Bohemians, Poles, and Ukranians, all with their own interests and issues important to them. The empire is also very unequal, with parts of the country in extreme poverty and parts of the country being very prosperious. We need to work towards compromising with minority interest groups and adressing the economic inequality in the empire in order to secure a stable future."

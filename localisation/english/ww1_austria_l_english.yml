ww1_austriahungary.14.t: "Government Approves New Russian Agricultural Product Bans"
ww1_austriahungary.14.d: "As tensions with Russia rises over instability in the Balkans, particularly in Albania, [AUS.GetLeader] has approved a series of new trade restrictions with Russia to attempt to economically punish Russia for its actions in the Balkans, hoping to use the trade restrictions as leverage later. For now, the effect has been immediate in raising prices of goods across the empire, as our economy already suffers from the livestock disease crisis."
ww1_austriahungary.14.a: "Was it really wise of him to do that right now?"
ww1_austriahungary.27.t: "Poles Protest Building of new Canals"
ww1_austriahungary.27.d: "Poles across the nation have began lobbying heavy pressure for the government to abandon the creation of new canals across the Danube, stating it would harm their communities immensly. They claim Galicia's economy relies heavily on railway transport used for exporting grain, salt, and oil. If the Danube canal system was improved, trade would increasingly shift to waterways, bypassing Galician railways and destroying their economy. They're currently using parliamenary procedure laws to block the projects from getting funding, though [AUS.GetLeader] can use a royal decree to bypass their concerns if needed."
ww1_austriahungary.27.a: "If it matters that much to them, we'll abandon it"
ww1_austriahungary.27.b: "They can complain all they want, but it's going to be law!"
ww1_austriahungary.22.t: "Appointing Next Minister-President of Austria"
ww1_austriahungary.22.d: "With the current Minister-President of Austria resigning, [AUS.GetName] is now tasked with appointing a new Minister-President. The major consideration for [AUS.GetLeader] is the question of if the next Minister-President should be a liberal reformist with tendencies to try and appease minority groups, or an anti democratic loyal autocrat who won't be afraid to show force if needed. Both have their benefits and drawbacks. Who should be appointed?"
ww1_austriahungary.23.t: "Picking the Ideal Canidate"
ww1_austriahungary.23.d: "While we've decided to appoint an autocrat as Minister-President of Austria, we must now decide the name. [AUS.GetLeader]'s advisors have brought a list of politicans that would fit the goals [AUS.GetLeader]'s agenda. Who should be appointed?"

ww1_austriahungary.11.d: "Since the passage of electoral reform in Cisleithania, tensions between Germans and Czechoslovaks have greatly reduced, to the point where the current situation is quite stable. Still, issues remain as Czech nationalist parties seek greater autonomy, while German nationalist parties attempt to agitate the situation. Czechoslovak labor unions are also organizing in an attempt to extract greater concessions from us. Bienerth has seeked to further stabilize the situation by passing a series of reforms across the Cisleithanian half of the empire to appease Czechoslovaks, Romanians, Poles, and Ruthenians."
ww1_austriahungary.11.a: "Limited concessions are probably for the best"
ww1_austriahungary.25.t: "A Tangible Solution to the Bohemian Troubles"
ww1_austriahungary.25.d: "With unrest increasing in Bohemia as Czech nationalists demanding reforms to Czech schools, [AUS.GetLeader] has proposed that former Bohemian governor Count Francis Thun return to this position. Thun was able to negotiate several concessions to the Czechs the last time he held office, to the point that Germans in Bohemia lead the effort to see him removed from his position. It's hoped he can also negotiate an issue to the Czech schooling question as well."
ww1_austriahungary.26.t: "Germans Shut Down Language Reform Attempt"
ww1_austriahungary.26.d: "Despite our attempts to introduce the Czech-requested reforms to the use of the Czech language in schools, German groups in parliament have sucessfully blocked our efforts, claiming it would harm German children's education as well as hurt the unity of the Austrian nation. Thus, for now, the attempts are dead."

ww1_austriahungary.8.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Ignores Our Concerns"
ww1_austriahungary.8.d: "Despite our attempts to stop it, several Hungarian Alispans have been fired in a move to make our empire's governments more effective.

ww1_austriahungary.6.t: "[AUS.GetLeader] Moves to Fire Several Alispans"
ww1_austriahungary.6.d: "The parliament of the Austrian-half of the empire has approved a motion with [AUS.GetLeader]'s endorsement to fire several ineffective local leaders and implement local government reforms at the Varmegyek level. Although we have no legal authority to overturn the kings decision, we could lobby a protest to try and convince [AUS.GetLeader] to reconsider the move, which has brought anger from Hungarian nationalists who see it as Austrian overreach.

Still, going foward with the move may strengthen the support of Hungarian nationalists who could use the incident to claim we are not respecting Hungarias rights to independent governance.

ww1_austriahungary.2.d: "Kaiser [AUS.GetLeader] has appointed Stephan Burián von Rajecz as Minister besides the King, or 'a király személye körüli miniszter', but not without its difficulties. Many have described Stephan as intimidating, and was described as 'the type of man who listened motionless, almost glassy-eyed, without betraying the slightest expression, responding robotically in a dry, school lecture without taking a breath.'

HUN_aftermath_of_werkle_desc: "In 1905, King Jozsef decided to dissolve parliment, due to the failure of the 1st Tisza government and the current impasse in parliment. The King called for new elections, expecting the iberal Party to continue its 30 year ruling; however, to everyone's suprise the allied-opposition defeated the liberals. The allied opposition that won was the coalition of Independence and Forty-Eight Party (F48P). The 48P opposed the Dual Compromise of 1867 and advocated for the goals of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parlimentary majority, appointed a trong-dualist. This government was shortlived and Sandor Werkle succeded as a compromise. The comrpomise government got little done and was beaten by the merge of the old liberal party, into the National Party of Work."

### EVENTS ###
##############
ww1_austriahungary.20.t: "Meat Shortges Collapse Support for Incumbent Parties"
ww1_austriahungary.20.d: "As the Austrian half of the empire prepares for new elections, the recent meat shortages are leading to anti incumbent backlash. Currently, Austria is dominated by the Christian Social Party, yet a coalition of liberals and nationalists now seem poised to break the Christian Social Parties dominance over Austrian politics."
ww1_austriahungary.20.a: "The emperor is the one who holds the real power!"
ww1_austriahungary.19.t: "Organized Labour Bickers Amongst Itself"
ww1_austriahungary.19.d: "Organized labor, strongest in the industrial regions of Bohemia and inner Austria, have enjoyed moderate cohesion in the past united in an effort to improve workers conditions for all. With elections upcoming, fractures between the movement are beginning to show. Labor unions aligned with Czech nationalist and German nationalist organizations are struggling to cooperate, seeing eachother as enemies instead of comrades united behind the struggle for better working conditions."
ww1_austriahungary.19.a: "That can't be bad news for us"
ww1_austriahungary.18.t: "Livestock Disease Crisis Effects Supply Chains"
ww1_austriahungary.18.d: "The beginning of the disease problem amongst much of our cattle has reduced our trade with other countries and hurt our own meat production. Now, with all of the pre-disease meat supply being sold in shops, supply chains across the country are offically being hit, quite hard. The price of meat has soared, with many shops reporting shortages."
ww1_austriahungary.18.a: "We'll have to weather this storm"
ww1_austriahungary.15.t: "Increasing Imports from Serbia"
ww1_austriahungary.15.d: "While we wait for the livestock issue to figure itself out, many in the government think increasing imports from Serbia temporarily could help prevent dramatic price rises. The problem, however, is that Hungaries aggressive anti Slav policies have dramatically strained relations between us and Serbia, and seeing our vulnerability right now, they're not likely to accept a new trade deal without Hungary reforming their treatment of Slavs in Croatia. Thus, we plan to offically request Hungary reform their treatment of slavs, so we can secure a trade deal with Serbia."
ww1_austriahungary.15.a: "It's embarrassing, but we need this"
ww1_austriahungary.16.t: "Austria Requests we Reform Anti-Serb Policies"
ww1_austriahungary.16.d: "Seeing the recent issues in our agricultural industry caused by livestock diseases, Austria is seeking to increase Serbian agricultural imports temporarily to prevent food shortages. However, our anti Serb policies in both trade and treatment of slavic citizens has lead Serbia to have zero interests in increasing trade with either us or Austria. Thus, Austria is requesting we make reforms so that trade with Serbia can be increased."
ww1_austriahungary.16.a: "Yeah, fat chance!"
ww1_austriahungary.17.t: "Hungary Refuses to Ammend Anti-Serb Policies"
ww1_austriahungary.17.d: "The arrogant Hungarians have refused to reform their treatment of Slavs on their lands, effectively killing our idea of increasing Serbian imports to help alievate a food crisis. This, combined with recent trade restrictions on Russia, means that our ability to avoid a temporary food shortage is reliant on us having good luck."
ww1_austriahungary.17.a: "Damn Hungarians"
ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály árolyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to orm a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. owever, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the ssasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."
ww1_hungary.10.a: "End of an Era!"
ww1_hungary.11.t: "Disaster At Lemberg"
ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While lfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on o. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."
ww1_hungary.11.a: "We have to point the finger at someone"

AUS_reduce_working_regulations: "Reduce the Minimum Resting Period"
AUS_reduce_working_regulations_desc: "Right now, we have strict resting period requirements for low skilled workers across the country. Although the idea behind the law was fine, the current standards are too much. We should reduce them to increase productivity."

AUS_tackle_galician_poverty_desc: "Galicia has a very high poverty rate compared to the rest of the empire, which has resulted in deep resentment from the peoples living there while also trapping the region into a stagnant economy.

AUS_investing_in_galacia: "Already investing in Galicia"
AUS_state_of_the_realm: "Ausgleich Political System"
AUS_state_of_the_realm_desc: "The Habsburg crown binds together a vast multilingual patchwork of provinces and local autonomies, all with competing parliaments, seperatists, and social unrest.

AUS_economic_patchwork: "Economic Patchwork"
AUS_italian_university_desc: "Despite the best efforts from irredentists in Rome, Italians have often been described as the empires most loyal minority group.

Doing so would be an easy way to gain more support from Italian locals in our empire."

AUS_fortwursteln: "Fortwursteln"
AUS_fortwursteln_desc: "A long 6 decades of rule under Franz Joseph has left the aging man tired, and perhaps not as proactive as he used to be. Still, the empire needs his service now more then ever, and as some Austrians like to say, he's 'fortwursteln', or muddling along somehow."

AUS_bukovina_autonomy: "Personal Autonomy for Bukovina"
AUS_bukovina_autonomy_desc: "Our current census system forces our own classification of what ethic group the citizens of Bukovina belong to. By changing the system to instead be self reported, we can allow Bukovinians to feel better represented, and also have more accurate census data."
AUS_prioritize_wellbeing_of_galacia: "Prioritize the Well-Being of Galicia"
AUS_prioritize_wellbeing_of_galacia_desc: "Improving the situation in Galicia should be a top priority of the government, as if we let poverty continue to run rampant, we'll never have any hope at fully stabilizing the kingdom. We should work towards expanding government funding towards the cause."

AUH_stitching_the_quilt: "Stitching the Quilt"
AUH_stitching_the_quilt_desc: "The Cisleithania half of the empire is full of Italians, Romanians, Bohemians, Poles, and Ukranians, all with their own interests and issues important to them. The empire is also very unequal, with parts of the country in extreme poverty and parts of the country being very prosperious. We need to work towards compromising with minority interest groups and adressing the economic inequality in the empire in order to secure a stable future."

ww1_italy.369.d: "Emmanuels assassin was an anarchist who no doubt had sympathies for the left. Many conservatives in the new government wish to see a harsh crackdown on all forms of leftism, including the PSI, which contains a very large revolutionary block that outright wishes to see our government be overthrown. On the other hand, many moderates warn that trying to ban such a large party in these times of political turmoil could cause a civil war. What course should we take?"

ww1_iw_italy.1.d: "After a brutal war lasting years longer then even the most pessimistic predictions, we've come out victorious. While one of the greatest triumphs in our nations history, the people at home hardly feel any especially patriotic feelings right now, only glad that the war that has drastically worsened their lifes has finally come to a close. The duration of the war saw inflation soar more then 400%, food shortages spread across the nation, historic levels of labor unrest, and hundreds of thousands of lifes lost. Although we've won, the streets of Italian cities hardly look like a nation thats won anything, and recovery is going to be a long and hard process."

ww1_iw_br_italy.23.d: "The rapid dissolution of the Austrian empire has came to a suprise to much of the Entente. The general plan post war was that an Austro-Hungarian state would exist, grant concessions to entente neighbors, and would become a secondary power in Europe. With the empire collapsing into various new ethnic states, the entente has had to formulate a quick reaction. To secure stability in the adriatic coast, a coalition of the willing has been assembled to occupy costal cities and prevent the outbreak of ethnic violence. This occupation is expected to be temporary as the Entente decides the future of who will own what on the adriatic coast, especially as tensions between Italy and Serbia ramp up over their differing vision on the future of the balkans."

ww1_italy.376.d: "With the war entering its second year, situations on the homefront are continuing to worse for Italians. Inflation is at all time highs, bread is unaffordable, and Italians simply aren't feeling patriotic. As the war continues, the demands for food for our soldiers are increasing, the deficit continues to be out of control, and people are being streched thin."

ww1_italy.378.d: "As the situation at home continues to worse, rationing programs at home are running into shortages. As many predicted, we only had enough food reserves to last around 2 years, and as we cross that time period, our stockpiled grains and cereals are running out. Combined with continued poor harvests, food shortages are worsening."

ww1_red_italy.101.d: "Since the start of the Risorgimento, Italy's government has shown extreme bias towards the north. Focusing industrial and infrastructure projects in the north, implementing tariffs that favored the north and hurt the south, as well as being much more violent to protesting southerners compared to northerners are just the tip of the iceberg. These policies have build lot's of resentment between the north and south, and while it won't be fixed overnight, ending these policies is a good beginning."

ww1_italy.377.d: "Although our government is attempting to spread nationalist propaganda and revigorate patriotism amongst Italians, it's not working. As the domestic front continues to worse, Italians are turning to the PSI who claims they would immediantly pull out of the war and help solve the domestic issues at home. As the popularity of the PSI grows, so does the revolutionary wing, who is threatening a revolution soon."

ww1_red_italy.87.d: "Following the collapse of Italian control in East Africa in the wake of the civil war, East Africas new owners have began seizing farm land from Italian settlers and distributing it to locals in the area, with alleged targeted murderings of Italian settlers also being reported. Although we're hardly in a place to intervene, we've set up generous resettling programs in Italy for those fleeing persecution."

ww1_red_italy.14.d: "A great schism has occured in the socialist government between localist, syndicalist, and anarchist forces vs state supremacists and bolsheviks. For weeks, leadership of the new state was heavily contested. Unions across Italy have threatened a second revolution if they feel their rights are being trambled by a strong federal government, and, using their large leverage, have suceeded in dominating leadership elections. Centralists have stepped aside and now we must decide Italy's next prime minister. "

ww1_red_italy.8.d: "With the rewriting of the constitution, article 1 has obviously got to go. Stating that "The Kingdom of Sardinia is a monarchy hereditary according to the Salic law."

ww1_red_italy.8.a: "The age of monarchism in Italy is over!"
ww1_red_italy.9.t: "Fate of Article Two"
ww1_red_italy.9.d: "Article 2 reads "The state is Catholic. Other religions now existing are tolerated according to the laws." We are going to abolish this, obviously, but there is a question on what the line should be replaced with. Many autonomists in the government wish to see Italy declared a secular republic, with freedom of religion guranteed for all. Some centralists however wish to see more forceful language used, to ensure the state can go after the church if needed."

ITA_mass_conscription_of_workers: "When We Fight, We Win!"
ww1_red_italy.10.d: "Article Five currently reads: "The King is the Head of the State: he commands all armed forces by land and sea." Italy obviously does not have a king anymore, and now we must decide who has oversight of the army. Many in the coalition wish to see the army beholdent to local unions and workers councils, while others want the prime minister to control the armed forces. What should we go with?"
ww1_red_italy.10.a: "The workers must control the army!"

ww1_red_italy.12.t: "Fate of Article Twenty One"
ww1_red_italy.12.d: "Article Twenty One currently reads: "The King appoints all officers of the State, and confirms the appointments made by the Ministers." It goes without saying that once again, we are not a monarchy. And once again, we must now decide who will appoint ministers. Some wish to see the prime minister have the power to appoint all ministers, while others wish to see ministers require a threshold of union support."

ww1_red_italy.78.a: "Goodbye, parliament!"
ww1_red_italy.79.t: "Parliamentry Members Declare New Parliament Illegal"
ww1_red_italy.79.d: "Opposition groups in parliament have announced they have no plan to hand their seats over to the newly appointed members of parliament, saying the Prime Minister has no authority to do such a thing. They intend to remain in their position no matter what, and to continue governing as a functioning check on the prime ministers powers."

ww1_red_italy.90.t: "Fate of Parliament"
ww1_red_italy.90.d: "With our asscension into power, the already whithering power of parliament needs to be dealt with all together.

Articles giving the king power over ministers, election procedures, and appointments of Parliament Members have all been revoked, although no replacement for these articles were made.

Starting off as a laborer, he slowly built up his beliefs concerning his rights and the rights of the men who toiled alongside him. Eventually though one realizes that change will never come unless it is acted upon, so Rigola became a deputy for the PSI, a post he only recently left to focus on the union. He was still relatively young for a politician, being in his late 40s. Metalworkers usually start losing steam around that age, Rigola counted his lucky stars that he was able to escape such a fate while continuing to represent and fight for the proletariat of Italy. The union, however, was losing steam. What can one do though when the need for the soldier grows evermore than the need for the laborer? The current regime seems hellbent on driving the nation to a war, and as he walked Rigola sighed at the thought of it. There is no glory to be found in war, only ditches filled with men who will never see home. A soldier's uniform will never hold you nearly as tight as a mother's embrace. Rigola opened the door of the place he would stay for the night, only to be greeted by one of those uniforms."

The soldier then elicited the help of policemen nearby, who arrived at 21:57 accompanied by a doctor.\n\nUpon arriving at the crime scene one of the police officers recognized the dead body as Secretary General of the General Confederation of Labour,  Rinaldo Rigola. The doctor determined that the wound was self-inflicted, thus being a suicide. The body was then taken to the morgue and notice was given to the owner of the residence."

ww1_italy.244.t: "Suffrage Riots"
ww1_italy.244.d: "Riots across Italy - both north and south - have broken out with workers and farmers alike demanding more representation in Italian politics. Right now, voting rights are very limited, leading to most Italians being apathetic to politics historically. As of recent, it seems that Italians see the status quo as unacceptable and are no longer accepting the current system. The riots have put pressure on both Giolitti and PM's in parliament to take action."
ww1_italy.244.a: "We must adress their concerns"
ITA_tide_of_progress_tt: "Pay attention to the mission §YThe Tide of Progress§!. If we do not complete it's requirements, our government will be almost guaranteed to §Rcollapse§!"
ww1_italy.265.t: "Fall of Aziziya"
ww1_italy.265.d: "Our troops have completely destroyed the Ottoman force in the town of Aziziya, with our forces now having control over the city. The battle was marked by the significant presence of irregular warfair, with both Ottoman and Italian forces not having any clear 'front line' near the town, instead being a savage fight between disorganized Italian troops and ambushing Natives and Ottoman troops. The mess aside, the town is now ours, and our march down south can continue."
ww1_italy.265.a: "What a win!"
ww1_italy.266.t: "Port of Hums Secured"
ww1_italy.266.d: "Our assualt on the naval port of Hums has ended in a Italian victory, with a rather brutal slog resulting in the small Ottoman force being overrun, with the Ottoman army retreating in all directions. The fall of Hum is a logistical victory, being one of 3 major ports on the west side of Libya. Our supply chains in Libya certainly aren't ideal, and hopefully the fall of Hums will allow us to bring in more supplies."
ww1_italy.266.a: "A key stragetic victory!"
ww1_italy.267.t: "Misrata Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.267.d: "The attack on Misrata has secured a decisive win against the Ottoman Empire, with our troops rapidly advancing in the town center and overwhelming the disorganized Ottoman garrison. With the fall of Misrata, our struggling supply chain in Libya should be relieved. The port will allow us to bring in more supplies to our army, as our advance into Libya continues."
ww1_italy.267.a: "Excellent!"
ww1_italy.268.t: "Fall of Sokna"
ww1_italy.268.d: "As our troops sweep through the brutal desserts of southern Libya, our forces have secured Sokna, one of the only notably large towns in the hot sahara dessert. Our forces met a combination of demoralized Ottoman troops and a large amount of militia from the local peoples there. It seems the Ottomans and the local people were already in combat, which made our job slightly easy. We've pushed out the ottoman force frm Sokna, and control over the town is somewhat secure although there is a high level of civilian resistance."
ww1_italy.268.a: "This war is coming to a close!"
ww1_italy.269.t: "Gheddabia Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.269.d: "Our forces are rapidly advancing in Eastern Libya as the Libyan town of Gheddabia has fallen to us. The town is home to a key railroad, which will allow us to supply our army as it advances into the dessert that surrounds the town on all sides."
ww1_italy.269.a: "We have them on the run!"
ww1_italy.270.t: "Fall of Bingazi"
ww1_italy.270.d: "A combination of naval bombardments and our assualting infantry have driven the entrenched Ottoman garrison in Bingazi out of the city. The key naval port is home to one of the largest cities in Libya, with its fall marking a significant blow to the Ottoman Empires control over the region. With Bingazi gone, it's likely going to be very hard for the Ottomans to supply their forces in Libya going foward."
ww1_italy.270.a: "Great job, boys, this one's gonna hurt them"
ww1_italy.271.t: "Fall of Derna"
ww1_italy.271.d: "Our troops have captured Derna from the Ottoman Empire, as our advances in Eastern Libya continue. Fighting in Derna was suprisingly professional, compared to the disorganized chaos seen in much of western Libya. Our forces beat a well organized, but inferior Ottoman defense that was garrisoning the city. Reports say that the Ottoman troops have fled down south in a disorganized retreat - one we should capitalize on."
ww1_italy.271.a: "A decisive victory from our army!"
ww1_italy.272.t: "Victory in Tobruk"
ww1_italy.272.d: "Our army has scored a victory over the Ottomans in the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya. Although initial intelligence suggested a rather small Ottoman presence in the city, the city turned out to have more defenders then thought. Despite this, our troops were sucessfully able to establish a strangehold over the Ottoman supply lines to the cities, significantly weakning the Ottoman forces in the city and allowing for a sucessful but more bloody then expected assualt."
ww1_italy.272.a: "We wiped out a large amount of their forces!"
ww1_italy.283.t: "Italian Ships Bombard Beyrut"
ww1_italy.283.d: "Early this morning Italian ships appeared off the coast of Beyrut, and tensions between them and our local forces began rising. Eventually after a long standoff, the Italian ships started bombarding the town. The bombardment caused widespread destruction as ships anchored in the harbour were sunk, buildings throughout the city were damaged, and numerous civilian casualties happened in the chaos."

ww1_italy.53.d: "In a sigh of relief for the Giolitti government, democratic and pro Giolitti socialists have managed to beat out a challenge from the maximalists. Maximalists have already began splitting off from the PSI and declaring the formation of their own party, although it hasn't seen much success. With the PSI remaining reformist, it open the opprotunity to Giolitti to secure a electoral alliance containing them, as he generally prefers them to the catholic block."

ww1_italy.74.d: "A large number of socialists have been kicked out of the PSI for their support of Giolitti and parliamentry procedures after the disaster in Libya. These socialists, claim the maximalists who have been leading the clense of the party, are revisionists who betrayed the workers of Italy by supporting their liberal oppressors. These expulsions have seen a dramatic increase in power by the maximalists, who have seen their pro revolution rhetoric earn them more support amongst the Italian public."
ww1_italy.75.t: "ANI Party Grow Significantly"
ww1_italy.75.d: "The originally small ANI has seen its members and strength skyrocket as the party has been running a highly successful anti liberal campaign, claiming under their leadership the Libyan disaster would never have happened. Their extreme nationalism as well as anti corruption rhetoric has made their message appear very inspiring to the Italian people - a people tired of the constant loses and embarassment on the world stage that the Kingdom of Italy has faced in it's recent history. They're seeing their movement go from a small, niche movement to rapidly becoming one of the largest organized parties in Europe. With this, it's expected they will capture a fair share of Italy's parliament seats come the next election - at least at the current rate of their growth."
ww1_italy.75.a: "Worrying"
ww1_italy.74.a: "Ha! They're tearing themselves apart"
ww1_italy.71.t: "The Greatest Disaster"
ww1_italy.71.d: "There's no other way to spin it: what happened in Libya was a disaster, probably the greatest disaster in the young kingdoms entire history. What was promised to be a cake walk ended up becoming a humiliating slog that ended in Italy's loss. Thousands have been lost in a war that was managed utterly disastrously by Giolitti.\n\nBoth socialists and nationalists have their own explanation for what went wrong. The socialists are claiming, despite many of them initially  being supportive of the war, that they knew the conflict was always a bad idea - an imperialist adventure over a piece of sand that would have brought no benefit to the common Italian people. The war, they are claiming, was brought on to Giolitti by the interests of big business who intend to use the colony and it's people as a tool to exploit to enrich themselves.\n\nThe nationalists claim the war was completely winnable, if the weak liberal leadership of Giolitti was run by someone stronger, someone who truly loved Italy and wasn't held back by degenerate and liberal values, as well as someone who didn't give into the demanmds of Europes other great powers. Demands that hindered Italy's ability to wage the war.\n\nWith such a resounding defeat after patriotic emotions being so high, many Italians can't help but to be swayed by one of these explanations. Both nationalists and socialists have seen their support begin to skyrocket lately."
ww1_italy.71.a: "Extremely worrying!"
ww1_italy.72.t: "They Told you so!"
ww1_red_italy.74.t: "Concessions to Corporations"
ww1_red_italy.74.d: "In order to reassure fleeing corporations that Italy is a safe place for them, [ITA.GetLeader] has been forced to make widespread concessions. Hes guranteed their assets won't be nationalized and promised a red line on certain concessions to the proletariat. Although some socialists are outraged, others understand [ITA.GetLeader] practicalism."
ww1_red_italy.74.a: "This will benefit all of us"
ww1_italy.72.d: "The PSI can't help but to remind the Italian people: we warned you the war was not a good idea. For months, much of the PSI waged a anti war campaign, warning the conflict would result in thousands of Italians losing their lives for no benefit to the people. And they were more right then they ever could have predicted. With loses in the thousands, the only thing Italy has to show for it is war reparations to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Many Italians have found themselves swayed by the PSI rhetoric - they were right here, the war was a complete disaster. Maybe they're right about the need for dramatic economic reforms across the country too?"
ww1_italy.72.a: "Oh come on, many of you supported the war!"
ww1_italy.73.t: "The Clearest Case for the Failures of Liberalism"
ww1_italy.73.d: "The Risorgimento was supposed to lead to a new golden age for Italy, one where it would be respected abroad and cement itself as a great player in European politics. What's the actual results? Losing 2 wars to nations in which we had significant advantaged over. Twice, liberals have completely blown it when it mattered most. Because of liberals lack of love for Italy, it's refusal to escalate wars in fear of the great powers of Europe, and the corruption of liberal governments, Italy has been completely humiliated on the world stage twice in a row. Only through strong leadership, anti corruption, and nationalism can Italy hope to fufill the ideas of the Risorgimento."
ww1_italy.73.a: "Liberty should be cherished by all Italians!"
ww1_italy.54.t: "International Pressure"
ww1_italy.54.d: "Our navy has clashed with the Ottoman navy in the Central Mediterranean Sea near the port of Preveza, in Greece. It seems this has caused quite the international reaction, as we're recieving demands from Austria, Russia, and Greece to limit our naval activities in the Balkans and to ensure the war does not spread into a regional conflict. This has outraged the nationalists, who are calling on Italy to reject the international pressure and do whatever operations in the war it pleases."
ww1_italy.54.a: "Whatever"
ww1_italy.55.t: "Austro-Italian Incident at sea"
ww1_italy.55.d: "Today, our coastal defenses open fired and sunk an enemy vessel. At least, that's what we thought happened. It turns out we accidently sunk an Austrian vessel instead. The Austrians are completely outraged, and we can expect a response from them soon."
ww1_italy.55.a: "Jesus Christ! This is completely their fault"
ww1_italy.56.t: "[AUS.GetName] Demands an Apology"
ww1_italy.56.d: "The Austrians have sent a formal demand to our government that we apologize to them for the accidental sinking of one of their ships. In addition, they are demanding that we 'avoid further escalation' of the war with the Ottomans, that we are under no circumstances to annex land from or expand the war to the Balkans, and that we are to limit our naval action in general."

He'd plan to propose it soon, but there was a real force of opposition on the right. He knew what to do, though. Giolitti got out his files that he had on every member of parliament. For every single member of parliament, Giolitti kept a small file about them: their weaknesses. Giolitti has always been a master at manipulation, and he often credited it to these files. He looked through the opposition, one by one he started formulating a plan to manipulate key PM's into falling into line. He wasn't worried anymore. He'd get it done."

ww1_italy.46.d: "The PSI has, for the past 3 Giolitti cabinets, elected to not stand in strong opposition to Giolitti and his cabinet. It seems they have voted to do the same this time around. The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There are leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists take over the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their Withdrawal from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."

It's caused chaos for the Italian minority in the Ottoman Empire, who now live in fear and many of which have had their lives turned upside down for what feels like no reason. Luckily, we've been able to take in some of them."

Although not exactly an unexpected move, some abroad were hoping we would take a more moderate approach and establish a protectorate system similar to the British in Egypt. The move has certainly brought delight to the Nationalist minority, who had been pushing for this since the 1800's."

ww1_italy.233.d: "Our knowledge of Libyas terrian is very surface level, and it's become a bigger problem then expected. Currently, our military have no maps of Libya, meaning we have little knowledge of the terrain and geography of the regions we are advancing in. Ottoman troops have been using this to their advantage, giving them a strong leg up in combat."
ww1_italy.233.a: "Whatever. It's not enough to save them"
ww1_italy.40.d: "Our troops and even Giolitti himself were under the, in hindsight rather naive, assumption that Italian troops would be welcomed with parades and gifts of home cooked meals by the locals of Libya who were desperately waiting for Italian troops to liberate them. This has turned out to be completely wrong however, as Libyan locals are just as resistant to Italian liberation as they are to Ottoman oppression. We've seen little to no local cooperation against the Ottoman Empire in Libya. If anything, the locals seem to prefer the Turks to us."

It comes as the socialist party drifts further and further towards revolutionary rhetoric as it intends to bring change through force instead of through the democratic system. These strike increases are leading to northern business owners calling on us to intervene, and favor employers in strike negotiations."

ww1_italy.36.t: "'No Justice, No Peace' vs 'a Revolution From the Ballot Box'"
ww1_italy.36.d: "There's been a debate amongst socialist circles lately on just how reformable Italian democracy is. There's an increasing sentiment of refusing to make peace with a system seen as unfixable. With Italy's current electoral system, only a fraction of Italians - generally more well off then the average Italian - are the ones who vote. How are socialists supposed to win in this rigged system?\n\nOn the other side, however, the more moderate reformists in the PSI still believe democracy is far from irredeemable. It has its issues, yes, but the sort of violent and anti democratic rhetoric from the maximalists is far from the solution. They instead coin the idea of a 'revolution from the ballot box' in which Italians will eventually wake up from the oppressions of capitalism and give them at least a major say in the make up of Italy's parliament, in which they will pass suffrage reform and thus secure an electoral mandate for years to come."

ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists in recent years. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims that the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. Some nationalists have indeed been calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of nationalist seperatists, unstable politics, and a neglected army. These texts are increasingly swaying Italians towards the idea of a war with the Ottoman Empire - an idea that was struggling to break out of fringe nationalist circles but is now increasingly gaining support."

ww1_italy.243.t: "Deals with the Mafia"
ww1_italy.243.d: "The Mafia has had a close relationship with Italian politicians for decades, and Giolitti is no different. They've had their fair share of interactions in the past, and with the rapidly changing political situation they've offered us a deal. In exchange for us giving them some... lenience in their activities down south, they will suppress maximalist socialists down south through their... own means."
ww1_italy.243.a: "Sure, but burn the documents of this deal afterwards"
ww1_italy.243.b: "It's too risky"
ww1_italy.23.d: "Several anti-war socialists have attempted to organize national opposition towards a war with Turkey. Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary, as such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Besides, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. Why waste political capital to oppose something that will probably never happen?"
ww1_italy.23.a: "Nothing Ever Happens."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to have our interests at heart. Austria is actively oppressing Italians in its borders, and the French have shown no respect for our legitimate claims in Africa and elsewhere. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Italy needs to grow stronger, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."

ww1_italy.21.t: "The Socialist Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.21.d: "The increasing public demand for a war to conquer Libya has come as a great suprise to the left. In their eyes, the issue was over with. Settled years ago in the Congress of Berlin. With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, has begun denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression, a war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of a minority group being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialists to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to create a rift amongst socialists in Italy."

ww1_italy.21.a: "Don't let them distract you from your real issues!"
ww1_italy.18.d: "The influencial Italian writer Corradini has recently published a new book promoting Italian nationalism and expansionism. In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming that the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with Europe's sick man. With the Ottomans being so weak, surely Libya would be easy pickings, right?"

In particular, the group seems interested in Libya. They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia. The group has began publications across Italy to rally people to the cause of Italian expansionism, and it's having its effect. More and more people are beginning to support colonial wars, with Libya being an especially popular target."

This question has been answered, as nationalists writers have came together and declared their support for the Triple Alliance.

Of course, these writers aren't dictating our policy, but their writings have swayed some."

ww1_italy.5.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Male Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. There are worries that some on the far left or right may try to rally against the bill. "

ww1_italy.1.t: "Giolitti's Support"
ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Luzzatti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."
ww1_italy.1.a: "We'll need to perfect the balancing act"
ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. Most of the PSI's power base comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely that around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to all of their demands. Still, it's not as if our overtures to the PSI have been completely useless, as we've been able to secure a small base of support from their party for our upcoming agenda."

ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysis are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country, catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists see him as weak at best, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a collapse, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a collapsing, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."

The press, however, has began pushing for a war with the Ottomans to secure Libya, with an earnest response from their readers. They claim Libya is full of natural resources and a population pleading for Italian liberation, being defended by a measly 4 thousand soldiers. Word of mouth proves quite capable too, with whispers being exchanged in parliament about how capturing Libya would be a walk in the park. It would be quite the treat if those whispers proved true, but you can never know until you try."

Nationalists have hijacked the media to rally the public behind a war, and some sort of confrontation with Turkey seems inevitable. The situation does not excite Prime Minister Giolitti at all, however. In his private speeches with parliament and military seniors, he's described his fears. As he put it himself, "The integrity of what remains of the Ottoman Empire is one of the principles upon which the world's balance of power is based. Therefore, I reject the idea that it is in our national interest to shatter one of the cornerstones of the international order. What if, after we have attacked Libya and destabilized the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans begin to stir? And what if a Balkan war provokes a clash between the two power blocs and a European war? Italy must not be the country that bears the responsibility of putting a match to the powder keg.""

In exchange for recognizing Ottoman suzerainty over Libya, they will simply hand us control over Libya. Recognizing  Ottoman suzerainty over Libya would change pretty much nothing. We'd control the territory, the resources, the laws, everything. Our soldiers would garison it. It would simply be ours in every defacto way.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this war is not just for Libya, its to rally Italy's political sphere to support Giolitti. Nationalists are increasingly becoming an influencial faction, and a war would easily gain their support. In addition, a war would surely have a rally around the flag effect and would allow Giolitti support of pretty much everyone, even for a temporary time."

It seems a liberal-catholic alliance is not crazy at all, at least not as crazy as you would think it to be 10 years ago, as alliances between catholics and liberals have been popping up in at the local level in Turin, Florence, and Venice.

With extremist maximalists becoming a greater force in the Italian political sphere, calculating working with Giolitti only serves to anger them, and fracture the party, Turati has been less and less open to working with Giolitti.

Indeed, Giolitti did take the opposite stance on the issue then the one he has been parading as of late, however Giolitti has presented his own argument to them on why Italy is ready for the expansion of the electorate. He's argued that Italy is much more educated and has much higher literacy rates then it did just 20 years ago, with education helping to build a 'regime of liberty'. Giolitti has, depending on who you ask, either boldly, or delusionally, claimed that Italy's working class will not be swayed by 'lunatics'. He argued that the general masses are smarter than given credit for, and that, as labor conditions improve through labor action, socialism will gradually decline in Italy.

While not followed by every catholic, it has definitely hindered Italy's ability to create a functioning liberal democracy. Despite catholics normally being an opponent to Giolitti, their participation in politics is a key goal for Giolitti. For one, they're far less emotional then the socialists. Working with them has, historically, been much easier. In addition, catholic participation in democracy is needed to give it legitimacy, which will strengthen it from any future authoritarian king or bad actor. Thus, while catholics are a political enemy for now, it's crucial for Giolitti that they still participate in politics. Besides, who knows? Maybe we'll find them to be our newest friends."

This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with.

In fact, our recent successes have made nationalsists so sure that we are curb stomping the Ottoman Empire, they are calling for us to expand the war. They specifically call for us to make naval landings in Albania and kick the Ottoman garrison out, which could cause mass revolts across the Turkish balkans and lead to a collapse of their empire in that region. It would deal a unrecoverable blow to Turkey and also secure us Albania.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this notion is completely infeasable. Our limited naval actions around Albania themself have caused mass protests from Greece, Russia, and Austria, who have threatened us into drawing back. Any demands of Albanian annexation would cause complete international outrage and isolation, thus we must stick to Libya."

The infamous socialist was a writer of a smaller marxist newspaper in Forli, where he advocated for a violent workers revolution against the state. The promotion of Mussolini is expected to push Avanti!'s publications further to the maximalist side of things.

He claims that the Catholic Church has, for years, worked with the King in collusion to crush socialist movements. Although a lot of Avanti!'s ramblings are seen as insane by the average Italian, the striking evidence and examples Mussolini provides in his article have raised... questions.

Recently, he's published a new article titled “Contro il Riformismo“, in which he writes a opinion piece against the reformist, parliamentarist, wing of the PSI. Only through a violent revolution can the workers achieve the dreams of Marx and the lives they deserve. By working inside the inherently bourgeoise dominated Italian political system, Mussolini argues that the socialists are helping to legitimize a government that should inherently be illegitimate. He claims that true democracy does not lie in Italy's sham and exclusionary parliament, but in the workers who provide the means of production.\n\nHis openly violent and anti democratic rhetoric is helping to push moderates away from the socialist party, and is radicalizing the core socialist base of industrial workers up north. While no true revolutionary attempt has been made yet, Mussolini appears openly be planning to stage one. It's clear that a tight leash on these socialists is needed."

The police got the situation under control, but not without killing at least 5 people. The PSI has been quick to denounce the shooting by the police as an unnecessary slaughter of workers exercising their right to strike and protest.

The crucial Catholic vote will help significantly with ensuring that liberals and Catholics don't end up splitting their vote up north which would lead to a socialist sweep. The alliance will also help ensure that the south is delivered to Giolitti's electoral block. Although the alliance does have one dramatic drawback: Giolitti's coalition had often in the past contained northern organized labor. With the formation of this allaince, it's likely that block will go to the PSI this time around. Still, this won't matter if the Liberal Union is able to truly unite Catholics behind Giolitti."

While the socialists are on theory our friend, on paper we know our partnership is quite temporary, and it's likely they will withdraw their support from our government within a few years. Radicals also performed well, defending many seats down south and helping to block catholics from reaching a significant number of members in parliament, although they still managed to gain a few seats. Overall, and perhaps dissapointingly to Giolitti, the biggest losers this election seemed to be the center left and center right.

In addition, there's a lot more socialists and nationalists than in the previous parliament, and despite attempting to work with both groups, they've proven to be a bit... stubborn.

Giolitti has had 3 cabinets already, and he's quite confident he can make another political comeback at a later date, thus he is considering a resignation.

The formation of this all leftist union has outraged catholics and conservatives, who feel Giolitti may be irredeemable now. However, the electoral alliance does make Giolitti's prospects in the next election very strong.

ww1_italy.97.d: "Members of the all-left coalition have been increasingly floating Republican ideas lately, with the majority of the coalition openly supporting the creation of a Republic. The problem is that the king is paying attention, and he's certainly not happy about it. The king has personally requested Bissolati help... get the coalition under control. Asking the coalition to tone done the rhetoric would, however, most likely cause immense anger. "

ww1_italy.106.d: "Yesterday, the Italian coast guard sunk an Austrian vessel in the Adriatic Sea. The Italians have claimed the whole episode to be a complete accident, but it lead to an outraged Austria protesting against the Italian government and forcing them to apologize on the incident at sea. They also demand them to implement several new restrictions on the war with the Turks. They include limiting naval activity severely and pledging to end the war as quickly as possible. While the Italian government has accepted these demands, it outraged Italians who view this as foreign powers once again controlling Italy's business."

ww1_italy.147.d: "In a move mirroring the Representation of the People Act in Britain, Italy's conservatives have worked with socialists to outflank liberals from the left, and pass an ammendment to a recent male suffrage bill expanding suffrage to women. With only Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Australia currently having women able to vote, this is historic move and might represent increased momentum for womens suffrage movements world wide. Already, women in America in particular are intensifying their fight for womens suffrage, with protests being organized in France as well."

The Italian government hopes this finally pressures [TUR.GetName] into signing a peace deal in their favor. This is an event that could change the tides of this war, as the Italians are now stationned with an army less than 50 kilometers away from Mainland Anatolia."

ww1_italy.114.d: "We've discovered that Confindustria is 100% involving themselves in Italian politics. They've been donating to and offering support ot, quite openly, right leaning canidates in preperations for Italy's elections. Now, it is within their right to do this, but some of the more... extreme members of the coalition wish to punish them anyways. We would indeed have a variety of tools to do this, but not only is it probably illegal, it would be unpopular amongst the public and amongst moderates in our coalition."

ww1_italy.115.d: "Some of the more conspiracy minded members of the coalition has insisted that capitalistic elitist groups like Confindustria were planning to hire a private army to march down to rome and overthrow our government. While never taken all that seriously, our investigation did look into this prospect and have found it to be nonsense. There are however, some in our coalition who have the idea to... greatly exaggerate what little we did find - talks between members of the Confindustria stating they'd much prefer a different government, and twist it into them plotting to overthrow our government, thus giving us justification to retaliate.

ww1_italy.117.d: "Members of the Confindustria obviously oppose unions as they reduce their profits. However, in our investigation we've caught the Confindustria helping stop unionization across the country through bribes and threats. Thus, we can persecute them for it. There is a question on just how far we should go, however. Moderates in the coalition wish for us to punish them to the full extent of the law and leave it at that. Extremists wish for us to use this to help dismantle the organization completely."

ww1_italy.121.d: "Germany and Frances retaliatory tariffs on us have lead to serious pain in many southern communities. While food gets more expensive, their profits shrink. It's increased tensions and economic inequslity between the north and the south, as the south increasingly see's Romes policies as only benefiting the 'Trianglular 3' industrial cities up north, where tariffs have seen a boom in available jobs. Many in the south have even opted to flee to countries like America."

ww1_italy.119.t: "The African Sinkhole"
ww1_italy.119.d: "Colonies certainly aren't cheap. Large militaries to protect them, modernization efforts, and supressing local rebels all cost lots of money. Unfortuantely, we're simply not finding a large abundence of resources in our African holdings in the horn of Africa to make it worth it. Increasingly, more money is needed to mantain control over the colonies, and they're beginning to become sinkholes."
ww1_italy.119.a: "They will be profitable eventually!"
ww1_italy.123.t: "Higher Prices... Are Leading to a Surge in Patriotism?"
ww1_italy.123.d: "What's more Italian than a high quality locally sourced bottle of olive oil, parmigiano reggiano made right in Parma, paired with a 2 year aged bottle of Barolo? Well, for a while, Italian production of these classic Italian goods had struggled to compete with cheaper, lesser quality foreign made versions. With our recent new tariffs, things are starting to swing back the other way. Italian specialities are increasingly taking back their rightful shelf space in grocery stores compared to their inferior foreign counterparts, and it's became quite the propaganda piece for the government. We've been able to spin this into a broader campaign of us putting Italy first, restoring Italian greatness, and co-opting nationalist sentiments in general."
ww1_italy.123.a: "We can really spin anything!"
ww1_italy.119.b: "Alas, the consequences of a free market"
ww1_italy.125.t: "'Trade Wars' Begin With Other Countries"
ww1_italy.125.d: "With tariffs being raised on several key goods, counter tariffs have been levied on us by several different countries. It's resulted in us having to make better do with what we've got, as well as both our imports and exports declining - although the former declining more then the latter. While its leading to higher prices, it's also strengthening our domestic industry and proving to be quite popular amongst nationalists."
ww1_italy.125.a: "The pros outweight the cons"
ww1_italy.124.d: "While tariffs on some key goods are inevitable with our new economic direction, theres been some limited calls from protectionist nationalists up north to implement a blanket, universal tariff on all goods entering Italy of around 5-10%. It would certainly, rapidly, result in a boost of goods being made in Italy. The downside would be a noticable increase in prices for many goods across Italy in which our domestic industry simply cannot make up for the reduced imports this would inevitably lead to. Shall we go with the idea?"
ww1_italy.124.a: "A great idea, we'll sign it immediantly!"

ww1_italy.118.t: "Industrial Drain from Italy"
ww1_italy.118.d: "An openly socialist government in the first place had always worried business leaders, but they had tolerated it - until now. Our investigations in Confindustria has worried business leaders, who see it as unfair and see themselves as the next victim. Many business leaders are gathering their capital and leaving Italy for other more business friendly countries."

ww1_italy.122.t: "Tariffs Attributed to Lower Unemployment Rates up North"
ww1_italy.108.t: "Radicals Propose Lower Tariffs"
ww1_italy.108.d: "Italy has oftem levied high tariffs on other countries, mainly for political reasons to gain the support of the north, while helping the north has not helped the south. It's lead to counter tariffs being placed on Italy, which has hurt the souths agricultural exports. Thus, some southern members of the radical party have proposed to Bisolatti that Italy negotiate lower tariffs with foreign countries to strengthen the south's exports. Of course, this would be unpopular in the north, but it is true Italy's tariffs are quite high and the south would benefit greatly if this went through."
ww1_italy.108.a: "No need to change the policy now"
ww1_italy.108.b: "Let's do it"
ww1_italy.122.d: "While steel has become more expensive, Italian steel manufacturers are finally able to realistically compete in the economy. Thus, many steel plants which had been at risk of shutting down have began to see a surge in business activity, with them recieving the ability to hire more and more workers. This has resulted in unemployment, which had began to moderately rise in the last years, start to steadily decline. While of course helping the local economy, it's mainly been a political victory as our government can directly claim credit for these events."
ww1_italy.122.a: "An Italian success story!"
ww1_italy.120.d: "Not taking too kindly to our blanketed tariffs on foreign grain, both Germany and France have quickly responded with counter tariffs of their own. This has lead to our exports down south facing a steep decline as the 2 countries made up a large bulk of our grain exports. Although this may help Italy become more self sufficent with food production, it will certainly make grain more expensive in the short term."
ww1_italy.120.a: "Nothing to Worry about"
ww1_italy.126.t: "Italian Companies Stocks Rise"
ww1_italy.126.d: "With protectionism leading to Italian domestic companies increasing their sales, Italian companies stock shares have been soaring. Up 8% in just a few weeks, many investors seem to be predicting that Italian companies will be seeing a dramatic increase in sales, production, and scale in the next few years."
ww1_italy.126.a: "Great"
ww1_italy.127.t: "Italian Economy Recalibrates to Tarriff Policy"
ww1_italy.127.d: "Although tariffs lead to a increase in prices on several goods across Italy at first, it seems prices have started to stabilize and even come down as Italian companies adapt to the new economic situation. This is helping to alievate some of the pain that has been felt on poorer regions of Italy from our protectionist policy."

ww1_italy.137.d: "For a long time, impoverished workers up north have felt forgotten about. Abandoned. At best, they were a tool for the liberal establishment type like Giolitti to exploit for political capital, and at worst brutally repressed by bourgeois aligned governments in Rome. With our new administration, many workers up north who have felt forgotten about are finally getting a hint of optimism. Hopes are high the socialists will finally be able to bring real change to them. Bring them real control over the means of production. Bring them fair and deserved pensions. Stop their bourgeois employers from repressing their right to organize."

ITA_social_revolution_cat_desc: "Italy is a beautiful clay, but it has no purpose or shape yet. We must reform the country to transform this clay into a paradise for the proletariat. The three largest areas that workers will look to for reform are the political, economic, and social sections of society. It will not be an easy task to reform all sections of society, but with time and effort, Italy will become a shining example.\n\nAs our reforms take effect, the benefits we receive from the socialist revolution will increase. Currently the state of reforms are as follows:\n\n§lFederal Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_federal_reform_var]%§!\n§LWe've inherited Italy's old and broken political system from before the civil war, a system that cannot stand. Proposals for federal reform range from a total destruction of the government to the construction of a totalitarian all-powerful state.§!\n\n§nLand Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_land_reform_var]%§!\n§LThe vast majority of Italy's land was owned by elitists in the latifondisti. With the victory of the revolution, we must now transfer this land to peasants.§!\n\n§QWorkplace Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_workplace_reform_var]%§!\n§LItaly's proletariat have faced unfathomable oppression by the burgereese. Reforms that empower workers over their employers is a necessity.§!\n\n§CEducation Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_education_reform_var]%§!\n§LThe Kingdom of Italy operated under a heavily decentralized and christianized education system.

ITA_free_trade_decat_desc: "Italy has historically used large tariff walls to shield its industries from foreign countries. While it has allowed for limited domestic industrial growth and a high employment level, its clear the policy has weakened Italy. Thus, as we work towards opening our country towards the world, we will have to be careful not to disrupt our economy too much. If foreign goods flood our country, local businesses and farmers may be forced to shut down, spiking unemployment. High unemployment will cause factory output debuffs, a political power debuff, and higher consumer goods. If foreign industries begin overwhelming domestic industries, domestic industries may begin shutting down, weaking our core industrial base. This will lead to lower stability, a political power debuff, and a construction debuff."

ww1_italy.398.a: "We're screwed!"
ww1_italy.397.d: "After unusually fast negotations, an agreement to exit the war has been reached. We've transfered a large portion of our industrial base to the enemy, and in exchange we've avoided having to give territorial concessions. Now, we can hopefully begin to stabilize the domestic situation and avoid a civil war."

ww1_italy.279.t: "Towards the End of the Normalization of Socialism"
ww1_italy.279.d: "Both Giolitti and Luzzatti worked extensively with the PSI to mantain the stability of their governments. Giolitti in particular, with his policy of trasformismo, significantly shifted the overton window on the socialist question from socialists being seen as radical and irrelevant outsiders to being a normalized part of the Italian political system with heavy say in the state of affairs.

While not an ultimatum, it's clear they're trying to gain German and possibly British support for an eventual ultimatum. Thus, we will need to end the war quickly before any sort of peace intervention can be made.\n\nThat is, unless, the French are willing to back us. Germany may be more then willing to help Austria and Turkey with a peace intervention if there's no risk to Germany, but with French pressure, we may be able to stop any peace coalition in its tracks."
ww1_italy.148.a: "Let's reach out to them, then."
ww1_italy.149.t: "France Backs us"
ww1_italy.149.d: "Lucky for us, France has published a statement urging Turkey to surrender Libya to us, and offering us their full support if any war were to break out with Austria. This essentially means any Austrian attempts to force a peace deal on us are void, although if the war drags out for years our hand may be forced anyways."

The ideological views of the judges we appoint will define how the judicial branch acts for the next chapter of Italian politics. We could pack it with reformist socialists that align with our views, ensuring the judical system remains nothing but a rubber stamp for our agenda, and that the judicial system blocks our political opponents.

This means we're likely to have a more multipolar parliament made up of loads of parties controlling a few seats. While electoral alliances are likely to be formed, it still means that governing is going to be much harder then it was before.\n\nThe make up of Italy's parliament will heavily influence who the next prime minister will be in the result of a government collapse. The make up of parliament is currently the following:\n\n[ITA_left_iw_loc]\n\n§7Independent Socialists§!\nThe Independent Socialists currently controls §C[?ITA_iw_ind_psi_seats_election]§!/§Y508§! seats in parliament.\n§LIndependent socialist MP's are various socialists who are not apart of any political party.

Some believe we would be hypocrites if we banned capitlist parties, who do enjoy support from a large percentage of Italians, as it would make our political system no more democratic then the autocratic monarchy of old.

In Tornino, local anarchists seized several factories and clashed with local authorities. After a few weeks, police were given the order to reoccupy the factories seized by anarchists. The anarchists moved to arm themself and the two sides exchanged gun fire. Anarchists sucessfully forced the police to retreat, and a indepedent commune has been declared. This quickly spread, with cripplingly high levels of industries being seized by these so called independent communes. As we move to resecure these key industries, a civil war is inevitable."

With only 4 other countries having achieved such a monumental reform, Italy's sure to be on the right side of history."

Being in charge of one of the most conservative wings of parliament, his endorsement has suprised many. Justifying his position in a speech to Italy's parliament, he's declared "It is only from universal suffrage that the government can achieve the strength amd legitimacy to represent and protect the general interests of Italy, which is continuously endangered by the particular interests of individuals, localities, and egotistical small interests groups."\n\nStill, the ammendment seems to lean towards failing. Many centrist members are hardly convinced by this argument, being more swayed by Giolittis idea of cautious expansaion of the electorate as Italians education and literacy increases. Gaetano Mosca, another influencial conservative, has also denounced the ammendment and called it a bridge too far."

Through rather generous interpretations of their our power, judges have used this to block all kinds of socialist action. Although never a serious problem before, with socialists in power the judges are now able to seriously hinder our ability to implement our agenda. Thus, we need to somehow deal with the judges. Laws protecting judicial independence mean an outright purge is off the table, but we still have means at our disposal. Judges can be removed if they are charged for corruption or misconduct. In addition, we have legal authority to shuffle judges around if minor positions open up, meaning we could place more anti socialist judges in lower authority positions and replace their high authority position with more friendly judges.

ww1_red_italy.100.d: "When Rome fell to revolutionary forces, many expected a red dictatorship to take over Italy and destroy democracy in the name of the proletariat. The establishment of parliament suprised many, although was expected to be a simple formality that would have no defacto power when comapred to the party elite that would actually rule Italy. The ascension of Bacci as well as the series of moderate acts taken by parliament certainly suprised international observers, and it's become clear to many that the post revolutionary Italy will indeed be a sucessful democracy. Achieving a true socialist utopia under a democratic system is certainly idealistic, but if anyone can do it, it's us."

ww1_italy.139.t: "A Nationalism of Envy and Anger"
ww1_italy.139.d: "In most countries, nationalist movements extensively highlight the glory of their current nation. Italian nationalism, however, tends to be quite uniquely pessimistic. While many glorify the days of the Roman empire, they have few nice things to say about Italy in its current state, maybe justifiably so. Firmly in the third rank of European powers, Italy has earned little respect across the world. Being given a pitiful piece of land in the Horn of Africa after being denied repeatably its actual claims, losing a war to Ethiopia, and having a military hardly better then the decaying Turkish empire are just a few examples of Italy's weakness on the world stage, and you'll often here the loudest critics of Italy coming from the nationalists. The call for radical change to make an Italy able to achieve the glory it deserves. Militarism, anti liberalism, and an aggressive foreign policy are all points you'll hear nationalists make. Assuming nothing dramatic changes, we can expect nationalist circles who claim to love Italy continue to insult it more then any so called “unpatriotic“ liberal would."
ww1_italy.139.a: "They have their fair share of grievances "
ww1_italy.138.d: "Southern Italy has failed to live up the dreams of The Risorgimento to say the least. The north, while not exactly Paris or London, lives in relative luxury, certainly living more lavishly then someone in Warsaw or Sofia. The south is, however, home to some of the poorest in Europe. Only living moderately better then Russian peasants, Italian farmers down south have been crushed by the North-focused policies of previous Italian governments, and left plundered by the practically colonial level treatment of southern farmlands for the benefit of the North. While many try to live their lives, holding bitter resentment, many have decided to flee the country. Most prevalent in the 1880's, millions of Italians have left to other countries - particularly the east coast of the United States. While emigration has slowed down, it's still very much ongoing in the South. This has led to a variety of issues - certainly our ego has been bruised by this, but the economics of losing millions of people certainly aren't helping Italy right now either."

Their opposition to the King's will expressed through him was to be expected, though it would be much more preferable if those seats were not theirs to take in the first place. The Radicals had fallen in line, albeit reluctantly. Any chance at progressive reform is gone, much to their chagrin. Lastly, the Liberals looked content, though perhaps they shouldn't be. Their current situation was not exactly ideal, but perhaps they would find a new Giolitti within [ITA.GetLeader]. Only he knew if that was to come, and his eyes wrinkled at the thought. Another thought crossed his mind: shall today be one of an iron fist or a velvet glove?

ww1_italy.131.d: "With across the board tariff reductions on agricultural products, a unique and unexpected lobbying effort to keep tariffs on one such product has gained steam: carrots. Local carrot formers in Terni have begun large scale demonstrations demanding we keep the carrot tariffs in place. They claim without them, carrots from foreign countries will flood the local market place at prices they cannot afford. Thus, they would go backrupt and have their very way of life ruined.\n\nSuprisingly, Italian nationalists have used these farmers as a rallying point, using the farmers as examples of every day Italians who will have their life dramatically worsened by the reduction of tariffs. The decision is ours, shall we accept their appeal?"

Our finances are already quite tight, so a massive cash injection to the agricultural crash may not be affoardable. We could instead lower agricultural tariffs, which would allow a flood of cheap food imports which would help alievate food prices, although our trade deficit would be sure to expand if we take this course of action."

ww1_italy.130.d: "With our free trade based policies seeing our agricultural exports soar to new highs, our recent farmer aid program has proven to just simply not be all that necessary. While programs like these usually end up dramatically reducing issues like poverty, with the strong performance of our farmers the program is becoming much more expensive then its worth. We must rule on if the program is worth keeping and running a large deficit on, as it has had some small scale sucesses, or scrapping all together."

ww1_italy.286.d: "When nationalist writers across Italy were attempting to rally support for a war with the Ottoman Empire, they often claimed that Libya would be a gold mine for Italy - both literally and metaphorically. Italians were promised an abundence of natural resources, friendly locals, and cheap fancy homes on the warm Libyan coast. With Libya having been under our control for nearly half a year at this point, it's clear these ideas were nothing more then a fantasy. On the contrary to having a large supply of natural resoures, Libya is becoming a drain on the economy. Natives are waging a brutal guerilla war, and Italians are more interested in moving to Chicago than experiencing Libyan carnage in Tripoli."

ww1_italy.369.d: "Emmanuels assassin was an anarchist who no doubt had sympathies for the left. Many conservatives in the new government wish to see a harsh crackdown on all forms of leftism, including the PSI, which contains a very large revolutionary block that outright wishes to see our government be overthrown.

ww1_red_italy.14.d: "A great schism has occured in the socialist government between localist, syndicalist, and anarchist forces vs state supremacists and bolsheviks. For weeks, leadership of the new state was heavily contested. Unions across Italy have threatened a second revolution if they feel their rights are being trambled by a strong federal government, and, using their large leverage, have suceeded in dominating leadership elections.

ww1_red_italy.9.d: "Article 2 reads "The state is Catholic. Other religions now existing are tolerated according to the laws." We are going to abolish this, obviously, but there is a question on what the line should be replaced with. Many autonomists in the government wish to see Italy declared a secular republic, with freedom of religion guranteed for all.

ww1_red_italy.10.d: "Article Five currently reads: "The King is the Head of the State: he commands all armed forces by land and sea." Italy obviously does not have a king anymore, and now we must decide who has oversight of the army.

It goes without saying that once again, we are not a monarchy. And once again, we must now decide who will appoint ministers. Some wish to see the prime minister have the power to appoint all ministers, while others wish to see ministers require a threshold of union support."

ww1_red_italy.90.t: "Fate of Parliament"
ww1_red_italy.90.d: "With our asscension into power, the already whithering power of parliament needs to be dealt with all together. With the expansive powers of the prime minister, we have the power to appoint new parliament members. Thus, a plan to stack parliament with loyalts has been finalized, and can now be enacted."

ww1_red_italy.84.t: "The Failed March on Rome"
ww1_red_italy.84.d: "Opposition leftist groups have attempted a coup to overthrow our government, motivated by our abolishment of parliament. Their attempt was a pathetic failure, with police and the military easily beating back the rioters, although casualities were Unfortuantely reported.

Articles giving the king power over ministers, election procedures, and appointments of Parliament Members have all been revoked, although no replacement for these articles were made.

In addition, it's no secret that we have our own ambitions for the Adriatic coast, including the regions Serbia occupies. Instead, we wish for these regions to be given to Albania, which will eventually be turned into an Italian protectorate.

Starting off as a laborer, he slowly built up his beliefs concerning his rights and the rights of the men who toiled alongside him. Eventually though one realizes that change will never come unless it is acted upon, so Rigola became a deputy for the PSI, a post he only recently left to focus on the union. He was still relatively young for a politician, being in his late 40s. Metalworkers usually start losing steam around that age, Rigola counted his lucky stars that he was able to escape such a fate while continuing to represent and fight for the proletariat of Italy. The union, however, was losing steam. What can one do though when the need for the soldier grows evermore than the need for the laborer? The current regime seems hellbent on driving the nation to a war, and as he walked Rigola sighed at the thought of it. There is no glory to be found in war, only ditches filled with men who will never see home. A soldier's uniform will never hold you nearly as tight as a mother's embrace. Rigola opened the door of the place he would stay for the night, only to be greeted by one of those uniforms."

ww1_italy.244.t: "Suffrage Riots"
ww1_italy.244.d: "Riots across Italy - both north and south - have broken out with workers and farmers alike demanding more representation in Italian politics. Right now, voting rights are very limited, leading to most Italians being apathetic to politics historically. As of recent, it seems that Italians see the status quo as unacceptable and are no longer accepting the current system. The riots have put pressure on both Giolitti and PM's in parliament to take action."
ww1_italy.244.a: "We must adress their concerns"
ITA_fuck_daggie: "Pay attention to the mission §YThe Tide of Progress§!. If we do not complete it's requirements, our government will be almost guaranteed to §Rcollapse§!"
ww1_italy.265.t: "Fall of Aziziya"
ww1_italy.265.d: "Our troops have completely destroyed the Ottoman force in the town of Aziziya, with our forces now having control over the city. The battle was marked by the significant presence of irregular warfair, with both Ottoman and Italian forces not having any clear 'front line' near the town, instead being a savage fight between disorganized Italian troops and ambushing Natives and Ottoman troops. The mess aside, the town is now ours, and our march down south can continue."
ww1_italy.265.a: "What a win!"
ww1_italy.266.t: "Port of Hums Secured"
ww1_italy.266.d: "Our assualt on the naval port of Hums has ended in a Italian victory, with a rather brutal slog resulting in the small Ottoman force being overrun, with the Ottoman army retreating in all directions. The fall of Hum is a logistical victory, being one of 3 major ports on the west side of Libya. Our supply chains in Libya certainly aren't ideal, and hopefully the fall of Hums will allow us to bring in more supplies."
ww1_italy.266.a: "A key stragetic victory!"
ww1_italy.267.t: "Misrata Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.267.d: "The attack on Misrata has secured a decisive win against the Ottoman Empire, with our troops rapidly advancing in the town center and overwhelming the disorganized Ottoman garrison. With the fall of Misrata, our struggling supply chain in Libya should be relieved. The port will allow us to bring in more supplies to our army, as our advance into Libya continues."
ww1_italy.267.a: "Excellent!"
ww1_italy.268.t: "Fall of Sokna"
ww1_italy.268.d: "As our troops sweep through the brutal desserts of southern Libya, our forces have secured Sokna, one of the only notably large towns in the hot sahara dessert. Our forces met a combination of demoralized Ottoman troops and a large amount of militia from the local peoples there. It seems the Ottomans and the local people were already in combat, which made our job slightly easy. We've pushed out the ottoman force frm Sokna, and control over the town is somewhat secure although there is a high level of civilian resistance."
ww1_italy.268.a: "This war is coming to a close!"
ww1_italy.269.t: "Gheddabia Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.269.d: "Our forces are rapidly advancing in Eastern Libya as the Libyan town of Gheddabia has fallen to us. The town is home to a key railroad, which will allow us to supply our army as it advances into the dessert that surrounds the town on all sides."
ww1_italy.269.a: "We have them on the run!"
ww1_italy.270.t: "Fall of Bingazi"
ww1_italy.270.d: "A combination of naval bombardments and our assualting infantry have driven the entrenched Ottoman garrison in Bingazi out of the city. The key naval port is home to one of the largest cities in Libya, with its fall marking a significant blow to the Ottoman Empires control over the region. With Bingazi gone, it's likely going to be very hard for the Ottomans to supply their forces in Libya going foward."
ww1_italy.270.a: "Great job, boys, this one's gonna hurt them"
ww1_italy.271.t: "Fall of Derna"
ww1_italy.271.d: "Our troops have captured Derna from the Ottoman Empire, as our advances in Eastern Libya continue. Fighting in Derna was suprisingly professional, compared to the disorganized chaos seen in much of western Libya. Our forces beat a well organized, but inferior Ottoman defense that was garrisoning the city. Reports say that the Ottoman troops have fled down south in a disorganized retreat - one we should capitalize on."
ww1_italy.271.a: "A decisive victory from our army!"
ww1_italy.272.t: "Victory in Tobruk"
ww1_italy.272.d: "Our army has scored a victory over the Ottomans in the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya. Although initial intelligence suggested a rather small Ottoman presence in the city, the city turned out to have more defenders then thought. Despite this, our troops were sucessfully able to establish a strangehold over the Ottoman supply lines to the cities, significantly weakning the Ottoman forces in the city and allowing for a sucessful but more bloody then expected assualt."
ww1_italy.272.a: "We wiped out a large amount of their forces!"
ww1_italy.283.t: "Italian Ships Bombard Beyrut"
ww1_italy.283.d: "Early this morning Italian ships appeared off the coast of Beyrut, and tensions between them and our local forces began rising. Eventually after a long standoff, the Italian ships started bombarding the town. The bombardment caused widespread destruction as ships anchored in the harbour were sunk, buildings throughout the city were damaged, and numerous civilian casualties happened in the chaos."
ww1_italy.283.a: "We will get our revenge!"

ww1_italy.346.d: "Although traditionally firmly on the center right, Sonnino has been forced to placate more to the center, as he attempts to combat the far right. This has resulted in a lot of smaller bills of parliament being passed with more votes from the center left then usual, while the small nationalist block in parliament votes against him."

ww1_italy.53.t: "Reformist Socialists Keep Control over the PSI"
ww1_italy.53.d: "In a sigh of relief for the Giolitti government, democratic and pro Giolitti socialists have managed to beat out a challenge from the maximalists. Maximalists have already began splitting off from the PSI and declaring the formation of their own party, although it hasn't seen much success. With the PSI remaining reformist, it open the opprotunity to Giolitti to secure a electoral alliance containing them, as he generally prefers them to the catholic block."
ww1_italy.53.a: "Thank God"
ITA_assassination_of_victor_emmanuel: "Assassination of Victor Emmanuel"
ww1_italy.74.t: "Mass Expulsions of Parliamentry Socialists from the PSI"
ww1_italy.74.d: "A large number of socialists have been kicked out of the PSI for their support of Giolitti and parliamentry procedures after the disaster in Libya. These socialists, claim the maximalists who have been leading the clense of the party, are revisionists who betrayed the workers of Italy by supporting their liberal oppressors. These expulsions have seen a dramatic increase in power by the maximalists, who have seen their pro revolution rhetoric earn them more support amongst the Italian public."
ww1_italy.75.t: "ANI Party Grow Significantly"
ww1_italy.75.d: "The originally small ANI has seen its members and strength skyrocket as the party has been running a highly successful anti liberal campaign, claiming under their leadership the Libyan disaster would never have happened. Their extreme nationalism as well as anti corruption rhetoric has made their message appear very inspiring to the Italian people - a people tired of the constant loses and embarassment on the world stage that the Kingdom of Italy has faced in it's recent history. They're seeing their movement go from a small, niche movement to rapidly becoming one of the largest organized parties in Europe. With this, it's expected they will capture a fair share of Italy's parliament seats come the next election - at least at the current rate of their growth."
ww1_italy.75.a: "Worrying"
ww1_italy.74.a: "Ha! They're tearing themselves apart"
ww1_italy.71.t: "The Greatest Disaster"
ww1_italy.71.d: "There's no other way to spin it: what happened in Libya was a disaster, probably the greatest disaster in the young kingdoms entire history. What was promised to be a cake walk ended up becoming a humiliating slog that ended in Italy's loss. Thousands have been lost in a war that was managed utterly disastrously by Giolitti.\n\nBoth socialists and nationalists have their own explanation for what went wrong. The socialists are claiming, despite many of them initially  being supportive of the war, that they knew the conflict was always a bad idea - an imperialist adventure over a piece of sand that would have brought no benefit to the common Italian people. The war, they are claiming, was brought on to Giolitti by the interests of big business who intend to use the colony and it's people as a tool to exploit to enrich themselves.\n\nThe nationalists claim the war was completely winnable, if the weak liberal leadership of Giolitti was run by someone stronger, someone who truly loved Italy and wasn't held back by degenerate and liberal values, as well as someone who didn't give into the demanmds of Europes other great powers. Demands that hindered Italy's ability to wage the war.\n\nWith such a resounding defeat after patriotic emotions being so high, many Italians can't help but to be swayed by one of these explanations. Both nationalists and socialists have seen their support begin to skyrocket lately."
ww1_italy.71.a: "Extremely worrying!"
ww1_italy.72.t: "They Told you so!"
ww1_red_italy.74.t: "Concessions to Corporations"
ww1_red_italy.74.d: "In order to reassure fleeing corporations that Italy is a safe place for them, [ITA.GetLeader] has been forced to make widespread concessions. Hes guranteed their assets won't be nationalized and promised a red line on certain concessions to the proletariat. Although some socialists are outraged, others understand [ITA.GetLeader] practicalism."
ww1_red_italy.74.a: "This will benefit all of us"
ww1_italy.72.d: "The PSI can't help but to remind the Italian people: we warned you the war was not a good idea. For months, much of the PSI waged a anti war campaign, warning the conflict would result in thousands of Italians losing their lives for no benefit to the people. And they were more right then they ever could have predicted. With loses in the thousands, the only thing Italy has to show for it is war reparations to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Many Italians have found themselves swayed by the PSI rhetoric - they were right here, the war was a complete disaster. Maybe they're right about the need for dramatic economic reforms across the country too?"
ww1_italy.72.a: "Oh come on, many of you supported the war!"
ww1_italy.73.t: "The Clearest Case for the Failures of Liberalism"
ww1_italy.73.d: "The Risorgimento was supposed to lead to a new golden age for Italy, one where it would be respected abroad and cement itself as a great player in European politics. What's the actual results? Losing 2 wars to nations in which we had significant advantaged over. Twice, liberals have completely blown it when it mattered most. Because of liberals lack of love for Italy, it's refusal to escalate wars in fear of the great powers of Europe, and the corruption of liberal governments, Italy has been completely humiliated on the world stage twice in a row. Only through strong leadership, anti corruption, and nationalism can Italy hope to fufill the ideas of the Risorgimento."
ww1_italy.73.a: "Liberty should be cherished by all Italians!"
ww1_italy.54.t: "International Pressure"
ww1_italy.54.d: "Our navy has clashed with the Ottoman navy in the Central Mediterranean Sea near the port of Preveza, in Greece. It seems this has caused quite the international reaction, as we're recieving demands from Austria, Russia, and Greece to limit our naval activities in the Balkans and to ensure the war does not spread into a regional conflict. This has outraged the nationalists, who are calling on Italy to reject the international pressure and do whatever operations in the war it pleases."
ww1_italy.54.a: "Whatever"
ww1_italy.55.t: "Austro-Italian Incident at sea"
ww1_italy.55.d: "Today, our coastal defenses open fired and sunk an enemy vessel. At least, that's what we thought happened. It turns out we accidently sunk an Austrian vessel instead. The Austrians are completely outraged, and we can expect a response from them soon."
ww1_italy.55.a: "Jesus Christ! This is completely their fault"
ww1_italy.56.t: "[AUS.GetName] Demands an Apology"
ww1_italy.56.d: "The Austrians have sent a formal demand to our government that we apologize to them for the accidental sinking of one of their ships. In addition, they are demanding that we 'avoid further escalation' of the war with the Ottomans, that we are under no circumstances to annex land from or expand the war to the Balkans, and that we are to limit our naval action in general."
ww1_italy.56.a: "Those Bastards! We have no choice..."
ww1_italy.47.t: "Sifting Through the Files"
ww1_italy.47.d: "Giolitti sat at this desk, pondering to to convince parliament to pass his upcoming male suffrage bill. He'd plan to propose it soon, but there was a real force of opposition on the right. He knew what to do, though. Giolitti got out his files that he had on every member of parliament. For every single member of parliament, Giolitti kept a small file about them: their weaknesses. Giolitti has always been a master at manipulation, and he often credited it to these files. He looked through the opposition, one by one he started formulating a plan to manipulate key PM's into falling into line. He wasn't worried anymore. He'd get it done."
ww1_red_italy.47.t: "Revolt Spreads to the Red Belt"
ww1_red_italy.47.d: "Across the red belt, where socialists usually perform strongest in elections, workers have began sabatoging railways being used by monarchist forces to attempt to crush the socialist revolt up north. In addition, many are taking arms with what weapons they can find, attempting to link up with revolting workers up north."
ww1_red_italy.47.a: "The red belt lives up to its name!"
ww1_red_italy.47.b: "The red belt will run red with socialist blood"
ww1_italy.47.a: "He's lead 3 cabinets already for a reason, after all."
ww1_italy.46.t: "Mantaining a Friendly Socialist Party"
ww1_italy.46.d: "The PSI has elected to, for the last 3 Giolitti cabinets, not stand in strong opposition to him. It seems they have voted to do the same this time around. The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There are leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists takeover the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their Withdrawal from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."
ww1_italy.46.a: "Let's hope they stick to their senses, then."
ww1_italy.40.t: "Not 'Liberators' After all..."
ww1_italy.299.t: "Pollio Dies"
ww1_italy.299.d: "Alberto Pollio dies, Italian army officer since 1908, has passed away today due to ramping heart problems regarding the myocardium. Luigi Cadorna has replaced him as chief of army."
ww1_italy.299.a: "Riposa in pace."
ww1_italy.236.t: "Pacifying Local Arabic Tribes"
ww1_italy.236.d: "Our offical annexation of Libya has only intensified currently existing hatred between Arabs and Italy. Many local tribes, especially down south, have began to organize resistance and refused to recognize Italian supremacy over themselves. Troops will be needed down south to put down these bugs."
ww1_italy.236.a: "Why are they resisting? We are liberators!"
ww1_italy.235.t: "The Ottoman Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.235.d: "As a direct result of our offical annexation of Libya, the Ottomans have expelled thousands of Italians across their empire from their homes. It's caused chaos for the Italian minority in the Ottoman Empire, who now live in fear and many of which have had their lives turned upside down for what feels like no reason. Luckily, we've been able to take in some of them."
ww1_italy.235.a: "How cruel!"
ITA_unknown_lands: "Unknown Lands"
ww1_italy.234.t: "Parliament Votes to Annex Libya"
ww1_italy.234.d: "Today, our parliament offically passed a memorandum declaring the region of Tripoli as a core territory of The Kingdom of Italy. Although not exactly an unexpected move, some abroad were hoping we would take a more moderate approach and establish a protectorate system similar to the British in Egypt. The move has certainly brought delight to the Nationalist minority, who had been pushing for this since the 1800's."
ww1_italy.234.a: "They are as Italian as Milan"
ww1_italy.233.t: "Struggle in Libya"
ww1_italy.233.d: "Our knowledge of Libyas terrian is very surface level, and it's become a bigger problem then expected. Currently, our military have no maps of Libya, meaning we have little knowledge of the terrain and geography of the regions we are advancing in. Ottoman troops have been using this to their advantage, giving them a strong leg up in combat."
ww1_italy.233.a: "Whatever. It's not enough to save them"
ww1_italy.40.d: "Our troops and even Giolitti himself were under the, in hindsight rather naive, assumption that Italian troops would be welcomed with parades and gifts of home cooked meals by the locals of Libya who were desperately waiting for Italian troops to liberate them. This has turned out to be completely wrong however, as Libyan locals are just as resistant to Italian liberation as they are to Ottoman oppression. We've seen little to no local cooperation against the Ottoman Empire in Libya. If anything, the locals seem to prefer the Turks to us."
ww1_italy.40.a: "We're doing whats best for them, even if they don't understand it!"
ww1_italy.35.t: "Business Owners Request Meditation in Strikes"
ww1_italy.35.d: "There's been a dramatic increase in strikes up north which is slowing down our industry. It comes as the socialist party drifts further and further towards revolutionary rhetoric as it intends to bring change through force instead of through the democratic system. These strike increases are leading to northern business owners calling on us to intervene, and favor employers in strike negotiations."
ww1_italy.35.a: "Restricting their right to strike will only anger them further"
ww1_italy.35.b: "We can certainly play a role in these strike negotiations"
ww1_italy.36.t: "'No Justice, No Peace' vs 'a Revolution From the Ballot Box'"
ww1_italy.36.d: "There's been a debate amongst socialist circles lately on just how reformable Italian democracy is. There's an increasing sentiment of refusing to make peace with a system seen as unfixable. With Italy's current electoral system, only a fraction of Italians - generally more well off then the average Italian - are the ones who vote. How are socialists supposed to win in this rigged system?\n\nOn the other side, however, the more moderate reformists in the PSI still believe democracy is far from irredeemable. It has its issues, yes, but the sort of violent and anti democratic rhetoric from the maximalists is far from the solution. They instead coin the idea of a 'revolution from the ballot box' in which Italians will eventually wake up from the oppressions of capitalism and give them at least a major say in the make up of Italy's parliament, in which they will pass suffrage reform and thus secure an electoral mandate for years to come."
ww1_italy.36.a: "How can you claim to represent the people without accepting democracy"
ww1_italy.36.b: "Italy's current laws make socialists legally being elected impossible!"
ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists in recent years. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims that the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. Some nationalists have indeed been calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of nationalist seperatists, unstable politics, and a neglected army. These texts are increasingly swaying Italians towards the idea of a war with Libya - an idea that was struggling to break out of fringe nationalist circles but is now increasingly gaining support."
ww1_italy.20.a: "That certainly sounds nice!"
ww1_italy.22.t: "A Divided Party"
ww1_italy.23.t: "Failed Anti-War Strike"
ww1_italy.242.t: "Aggressive Posturing"
ww1_italy.242.d: "With pressure to claim Libya increasing, our diplomats in the Ottoman empire have increasingly been turning of the heat on the declining empire. A variety of complaints have been levied: unfair trade practices, unfair treatment of Italian minorities in their country, and more. It's satisifying the nationalists, who are hungry for conflict."
ww1_italy.242.a: "We must project strength!"
ww1_italy.243.t: "Deals with the Mafia"
ww1_italy.243.d: "The Mafia has had a close relationship with Italian politicians for decades, and Giolitti is no different. They've had their fair share of interactions in the past, and with the rapidly changing political situation they've offered us a deal. In exchange for us giving them some... lenience in their activities down south, they will suppress maximalist socialists down south through their... own means."
ww1_italy.243.a: "Sure, but burn the documents of this deal afterwards"
ww1_italy.243.b: "It's too risky"
ww1_italy.23.d: "Several anti-war socialists have attempted to organize national opposition towards a war with Turkey. Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary, as such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Besides, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. Why waste political capital to oppose something that will probably never happen?"
ww1_italy.23.a: "Nothing Ever Happens."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to have our interests at heart. Austria is actively oppressing Italians in its borders, and the French have shown no respect for our legitimate claims in Africa and elsewhere. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Italy needs to grow stronger, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."
ww1_italy.19.a: "Not a bad idea."
ww1_italy.18.t: "La Guerra Lontana"
ww1_italy.21.t: "The Socialist Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.21.d: "The increasing public demand for a war to conquer Libya has come as a great suprise to the left. In their eyes, the issue was over with. Settled years ago in the Congress of Berlin. With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, have began denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression, a war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of a minority group being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialists to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to create a rift amongst socialists in Italy."
ww1_italy.22.a: "The socialist party is anti war at heart, no?"
ww1_italy.22.b: "Nationalistic socialists huh? Interesting"
ww1_italy.21.a: "Don't let them distract you from your real issues!"
ww1_italy.18.d: "The influencial Italian writer Corradini has recently published a new book promoting Italian nationalism and expansionism. In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming that the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with Europe's sick man.

In particular, the group seems interested in Libya. They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia. The group has began publications across Italy to rally people to the cause of Italian expansionism, and it's having its effect. More and more people are beginning to support colonial wars, with Libya being an especially popular target."

This question has been answered, as nationalists writers have came together and declared their support for the Triple Alliance.

Most of the PSI's power base comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely that around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to all of their demands.

Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon.

Thus, the nationalists have shifted towards claiming credit for starting the war in the first place. They claim Giolitti only started the war out of a pressure campaign from the nationalists. Their claims do, of course, have a level of truth to them. This has led towards their support increasingl amongst the Italian people dramatically."

ww1_italy.49.t: "Nationalists Claim the Country is Failing"
ww1_italy.49.d: "Weakness on the international stage, millions of Italians fleeing Italy for a better life elsewhere, a pitiful Military. The nationalists are highlighting all these things, and claiming Italy is failing as a nation. They say that under liberal leadership, Italy has fallen behind other countries and has allowed itself to become a laughing stock on the international stage. They claim only they can fix it."
ww1_italy.49.a: "How can they claim to love their country while saying such things?"
ww1_italy.45.d: "Turati (the leader of the PSI) has been in complete favor with working together with Giolitti on legislation advancing the rights of workers and peasants alike. However, it seems Turati has calculated that cooperation with Giolitti is becoming less and less politically viable. With extremist maximalists becoming a greater force in the Italian political sphere, calculating working with Giolitti only serves to anger them, and fracture the party, Turati has been less and less open to working with Giolitti. Thus, Giolitti's overtures to Turati have been increasingly rebutted, as Turati seeks to mantain the unity of his party."
ww1_italy.45.a: "We need these Maximalists to be crushed!"
ww1_italy.34.t: "On the General Political Maturity of the Italian People"
ww1_italy.34.d: "Giolitti's recent expansion of the electorate has recieved criticism amongst some of the political elites of Italy. Indeed, Giolitti did take the opposite stance on the issue then the one he has been parading as of late, however Giolitti has presented his own argument to them on why Italy is ready for the expansion of the electorate. He's argued that Italy is much more educated and has much higher literacy rates then it did just 20 years ago, with education helping to build a 'regime of liberty'. Giolitti has, depending on who you ask, either boldly, or delusionally, claimed that Italy's working class will not be swayed by 'lunatics'. He argued that the general masses are smarter than given credit for, and that, as labor conditions improve through labor action, socialism will gradually decline in Italy. He certainly isn't swaying any conservatives with his arguments, but some of the old guard liberals are starting to come around."
ww1_italy.34.a: "We have to have some faith in the Italian people!"
ww1_italy.33.t: "Foundations of a Healthy Democracy"
ww1_italy.33.d: "Since Italy's founding, Catholics have been ordered by the pope to not participate in government in any form, including not voting in elections. While not followed by every catholic, it has definitely hindered Italy's ability to create a functioning liberal democracy. Despite catholics normally being an opponent to Giolitti, their participation in politics is a key goal for Giolitti. For one, they're far less emotional then the socialists. Working with them has, historically, been much easier. In addition, catholic participation in democracy is needed to give it legitimacy, which will strengthen it from any future authoritarian king or bad actor. Thus, while catholics are a political enemy for now, it's crucial for Giolitti that they still participate in politics. Besides, who knows? Maybe we'll find them to be our newest friends."
ww1_italy.33.a: "It's all true!"
ww1_italy.7.a: "Calm down! It's only a minor setback"
ww1_italy.29.t: "Does Giolitti Still Got It?"
ww1_italy.29.d: "Giolitti has always been a master of the art of trasformismo. Isolating and allying whatever factions of Italy that make sense for his current ambitions. This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with. Clearly, by passing male suffrage in the first place, Giolitti believes he can handle it, but will he really be able to?"

ww1_italy.41.a: "Non sarà mai dimenticato."
ww1_italy.42.t: "To Albania and Beyond!"
ww1_italy.42.d: "Our recent successes in the Libyan campaign have led to an even greater nationalist fever in Italy then before. People are celebrating our success, the inevitable collapse of the Ottoman military, and are awaiting for us to push them completely out of Libya. In fact, our recent successes have made nationalsists so sure that we are curb stomping the Ottoman Empire, they are calling for us to expand the war. They specifically call for us to make naval landings in Albania and kick the Ottoman garrison out, which could cause mass revolts across the Turkish balkans and lead to a collapse of their empire in that region. It would deal a unrecoverable blow to Turkey and also secure us Albania.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this notion is completely infeasable. Our limited naval actions around Albania themself have caused mass protests from Greece, Russia, and Austria, who have threatened us into drawing back. Any demands of Albanian annexation would cause complete international outrage and isolation, thus we must stick to Libya."
ww1_italy.42.a: "The nationalists are gonna have a hard time stomaching this."
ww1_italy.43.t: "Unless..."
ww1_italy.43.d: "Albania may be off limits, but there's still places we can expand the war. We've been eyeing up the Dodecanese for a while now, and there's been little to no protest from any country but the Greeks at our naval presense near the islands. Thus, we should be able to easily take them for ourself. It's not the prize that Albania is, but it should still help to satisfy the nationalists, and besides the island are indeed useful naval bases."
ww1_italy.44.t: "A Rather Mediocre Peace Deal"
ww1_italy.44.d: "These are the words being used to describe the Treaty of Ouchy with the Ottoman Empire. There's no other way to spin it, they claim. Italy could have, should have, and would have under bolder leadership, demanded the annexation of Albania. The only reason they didn't was because of pressure from the European great powers, those bastards. Italy should never have given into their demands, they claim."

ww1_italy.39.d: "We've been recieving reports that recently immigrated Italians in Libya have been facing blatant discrimination by the Ottoman government. The allegations accuse Turkey of not doing anything to stop harassment of Italian citizens and doing nothing to stop locals from charging Italians higher rates for goods and services. This has outraged nationalists across the country, as they call for the government to intervene and put the Ottomans in their place, and for Italy to take the territory for itself to secure protection for Italian citizens."

ww1_italy.32.d: "Representatives from the PSI have gathered in a highly anticipated party conference. The party conference comes as the so-called 'maximalist' faction of the PSI has seen a rapid increase in influece in the last few years, and party control is contested greatly this time around. If the maximalists secure controll of the party, it's likely they will withdraw all support from Giolitti's government."
ww1_italy.32.a: "Well, get on with it now!"
ww1_italy.52.t: "Maximalists Takeover the PSI"
ww1_italy.52.d: "The 'Maximalist' faction of the PSI has prevailed at the party convention held recently. Already, the party has started going under dramatic reconstruction. Moderates have been kicked out of the party, with a new moderate socialist party already being formed. Most importantly, and also worryingly, they've denounced cooperation with Giolitti and are encouraging members of the PSI to refuse to work with him. Giolitti's coalition has enjoyed a decent amount of socialist support in the past, and with support from the PSI being pretty much a done deal, Giolitii will have to look towards other coalition partners."
ww1_italy.52.a: "Damn it!"
ww1_italy.31.t: "Socialists Distrust Giolitti's Suffrage Reform"
ww1_italy.31.d: "Expansion of suffrage is one of the key talking points amongst socialists, so you can imagine Giolitti's confusion when he started recieving attacsk from socialists over it. They claim Giolitti must have some sort of alternative motive with the new law, that wants to insult the lower classes by ensuring would not enjoy the prestige and self-fulfillment of electing a government which granted them the right to vote. It's a nonsensical argument, but it's being met with agreement by a suprisingly large amount of socialists. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't they be greatful?"
ww1_italy.31.a: "Are they mentally ill?"
ww1_italy.30.t: "Relegated to the Attic in Italy"
ww1_italy.30.d: "...These are the words Giolitti used to describe Karl Marx and his ideas. It's created outrage amongst Italian socialists, who have much admiration for the man. While Giolittis standing amongst socialists is shaky, he had enjoyed some support from the more moderate members of the party. This recent gaffe has damaged his support amongst them, however, as the comment was seen as a rejection of socialism as a whole. This combined with his recent overtures to nationalist factions have resulted in him being seen increasingly see him as someone who can't be worked with in good faith."

ww1_italy.180.d: "As we work towards entrenching our rule in Libya, the question of what we should do with the old laws in Libya has came up. Laws have different punishments for crimes, different property rights, and different laws on religion. While it would make sense to enforce our law system on Libya, doing so may disrupt many Libyans way of life in a way that could lead to protests."

ww1_italy.181.t: "Question of 'Italianization' in Libya"
ITA_conscription_reform_law: "Reform Mandatory Service"
ww1_italy.181.d: "Many nationalists see Libya as a rightful piece of the Italian empire, but the truth is the vast majority of the population doesn't have much pride in their new status as Italians. Some in the government want us to push a vast initiative of 'Italianization' of minorities, where we will push Italian culture and our language on indigenous peoples in an attempt to turn them and their children more Italian. This of course has been decried by socialists and many liberals in the government, who see this as morally wrong and promoting a Libyan rebellion."
ww1_italy.181.t: "Fate of the Arabic Language in Libya"
ww1_italy.181.d: "With our new territory in Libya speaking primarily Arabic, we must decide what languages we authorize schools to teach. The obvious answer is to allow both Italian and Arabic to be learned in school, but some more radical members of the government suggest we should slowly phase out Arabic in schools. This would cause massive resistance but would definitely help make Libya more 'Italian', which could benefit in later years."
ww1_italy.181.a: "Arabic and Italian will both be taught"
ww1_italy.181.b: "Phase out Arabic slowly but surely"
ww1_italy.180.b: "Libyans will follow the law of the country they live in!"
ww1_italy.179.d: "Libya is a mostly muslim territory, as opposed to the catholic Italy. Many in the Catholic Church want to work towards converting Libya to Christianity, but Giolitti has been more apprehensive to this idea. As a strong proponent of seperation between church and state, the idea of allowing the Church a free hand to do whatever they wish in Libya is worrying to him. Although, doing so would bring greater catholic support to Giolitti, which will be crucial towards mantaining his regime. "

ww1_italy.61.d: "Giolitti's 4th cabinet has met the fate of his last 3: resignation. With a polarized parliament becoming more and more resistant to trasformismo and generally disliking Giolitti's policies, his government has lost the high levels of support it needs to function. With this, Giolitti has handed his resignation to the king. It's not clear who will be Giolitti's sucessor yet, but it looks like whoever gets Giolitti's endorsement will have the best shot."

ww1_italy.287.d: "Italy's chain of command is full of nepotism to the core, to the point that a decently high ranking army position is to be expected to go to the sons of rich aristocrats. The chain of command is very ineffective, with very inexperienced and just plain incompetent men serving at the top. If we wish to win a war with any country containing a serious army, reform of some sort needs to take place."

ww1_italy.69.t: "The Conservative Successor"
ww1_italy.69.d: "Giolitti's fall could mainly be blamed on the left, thus it was important to Giolitti that his successor would be able to handle them well. Because of this, he endorses Antonio Salandra, a quite conservative member of the liberal union. Antonio Salandra is one of the most conservative prime ministers Italy has seen in a while, and his appointment certainly won't be popular amongst the left."

ww1_italy.262.t: "Avanti!'s Newest Writer"
ww1_italy.262.d: "Avanti, the largest socialist newspaper in Italy and offical piece of the PSI, has had a dramatic change in leadership, with Benito Mussolini being promoted to the head writer of Avanti!. The infamous socialist was a writer of a smaller marxist newspaper in Forli, where he advocated for a violent workers revolution against the state. The promotion of Mussolini is expected to push Avanti!'s publications further to the maximalist side of things. With such a large base of readers, Mussolini's writings, which are likely to advocate for violent strikes and revolutionary activities, is likely going to destabilize the Italian political situation."
ww1_italy.262.a: "He's insane!"
ww1_italy.263.t: "Il Trono e l'Altare"
ww1_italy.263.d: "Benito Mussolini's latest Avanti! publication is gaining national traction. Titled “The Throne and the Altar”, Mussolini gives a scathing criticism of both the Catholic Church and the monarchy. He claims that the Catholic Church has, for years, worked with the King in collusion to crush socialist movements. Although a lot of Avanti!'s ramblings are seen as insane by the average Italian, the striking evidence and examples Mussolini provides in his article have raised... questions. It is true that the Catholic Church has been far from apolitical in Italy's history, and the reported incidents of voter supression up North are not getting ignored by Italians."
ww1_italy.263.a: "Everyone should see this for the insane conspiracy theory it is!"
ww1_italy.264.t: "Contro il Riformismo"
ww1_italy.264.d: "The PSI has became increasingly dominated by violent radicals in recent years. Included in this takeover of the PSI is the maximalist Benito Mussolini's aquirement of Avanti!, the largest socialist newspaper in Italy. Recently, he's published a new article titled “Contro il Riformismo“, in which he writes a opinion piece against the reformist, parliamentarist, wing of the PSI. Only through a violent revolution can the workers achieve the dreams of Marx and the lives they deserve. By working inside the inherently bourgeoise dominated Italian political system, Mussolini argues that the socialists are helping to legitimize a government that should inherently be illegitimate. He claims that true democracy does not lie in Italy's sham and exclusionary parliament, but in the workers who provide the means of production.\n\nHis openly violent and anti democratic rhetoric is helping to push moderates away from the socialist party, and is radicalizing the core socialist base of industrial workers up north. While no true revolutionary attempt has been made yet, Mussolini appears openly be planning to stage one. It's clear that a tight leash on these socialists is needed."
ww1_italy.264.a: "But what can we do?"
ww1_italy.67.d: "The influencial maximalist Benito Mussolini was arrested today for leading a anti war riot. The riot was quickly broken up by police and lead to him being arrested by police and sentenced to a jail sentence of a few months. Mussolini and other socialists have been quick to denounce the arrest as unjustified. Ironically, the arrest of Mussolini has only brought more attention to the maximalists, and its lead to their popularity increasing."

ww1_italy.68.d: "2 influencial socialists, Ivanoe Bonomi and Leonida Bissolati, have been expelled from the PSI due to them supporting the Ottoman Italian war, which although proved to be popular at first has quickly became detested by socialists across the country. The maximalists in particular were the main drivers behind their expulsion, and them helping to expell Bonomi and Bissolati has increased their strength in the PSI."

With very little public support and all confidence in him lost, Giolitti has handed in his resignation to the king. In his place, Giolitti has reccomended Antonio Salandra as his replacement, and thus the king has tasked him with forming a new government."

ww1_italy.83.d: "The recent few months of chaos across the country have caused Italians to rapidly polarize, with a plurality of Italians now supporting either socialism or nationalism. People are fed up with a country that's lost 2 wars it should have won, that's seen millions have to flee to other countries because Italy's economy wasn't good enough for them, thats recently been engulfed in riots, that's been ruled by corrupt centrists for the last 30 years and so on and so forth. People want change, and they don't believe that centrist liberals can bring it anymore. One thing's for sure, Italy's next elections are going to see a dramatically different parliament. "
ww1_italy.83.a: "Nonsense, we'll stabilize soon!"
ww1_italy.82.d: "While the general strike up north has been put to an end, the situation in the country can hardly be called stable. With Salandra already unpopular down south, his new emergency powers have southerners worried that he intends to become a dictator and continue enforcing pro-north policies on their backs. It's led to mass anti-Salandra protests taking place, with some led by the ANI turning into riots. Although currently the death count is zero, nearly a hundred people have been arrested and several incidents have led to injuries."

It's outraged northern business, but has successfully brought most people back to work. Interestingly enough, Salandra has refused to yield his emergency powers yet, saying it's “too early“ to relinquish them. This has led to the PSI hurling a whole new range of attacks on Salandra, calling him an offical dictator with some maximalists even calling for him to be violently overthrown."
ww1_italy.81.a: "Will things return to as they once were?"
ww1_italy.79.d: "Armed workers have been caught up in standoffs with police across the country, as the murder of workers up north and the general increase of violence has led to a mass panic amongst the workers that they may find themselves the victim of a brutal and sudden crackdown if they do not arm themselves. This has led to viral photos of armed workers staring down police in more then 1 part of the country, although no actual incidents have been reported so far. Parliament, and the King, have been called to convene with Salandra to discuss a response as the situation looks dire."

Across the country, several Italians have been severly injured as clashes with police and civilians have lead to regrettable aftermaths. The situation has become extremely worrying to Salandra, who isn't sure what to do about the state of the country. Sending in the army or the police could cause a civil war, but with the current direction of the country, doing nothing might too."
ww1_italy.78.a: "We must make it through this!"
ww1_italy.76.d: "Seeing Salandras's widespread unpopularity, the socialists have cast the die. Socialists have organized several labor unions into a general strike. They're demanding a wide variety of benefits - increased pay, less hours, stricter labor standards, and more. This has put Salandras's government between a rock and a hard place. The general strike is sure to nuke his popularity even further, as prices rise. He can't, however, give into their demands. Parliamemt is simply too moderate to get such an expansive bill through parliament. While Salandra has been trying to play meditator, he's failed to stop the strike from happening."

ww1_italy.77.d: "The police had been called to deal with a riot up north, and the aftermath has made headline news across the country. Rioting workers refused to cooperate with local authorities, and although its unknown which side attacked first, after trying to arrest a group of armed workers, a riot broke out. The police got the situation under control, but not without killing at least 5 people. The PSI has been quick to denounce the shooting by the police as an unnecessary slaughter of workers exercising their right to strike and protest. This incident has led to a wave of fear and outrage across Italy, as workers fear the police could come after them next. Several workers are looking towards arming themselves, and the situation has some worried Italy is on the verge of a revolution."
ww1_italy.58.t: "Formation of the Liberal Union"
ww1_italy.58.d: "Perhaps the most egregious example of trasformiso has hit Italy as Giolitti's most traditional oppostion group: Catholics, have paraded a electoral alliance with Giolitti formed just a few days ago. The crucial Catholic vote will help significantly with ensuring that liberals and Catholics don't end up splitting their vote up north which would lead to a socialist sweep. The alliance will also help ensure that the south is delivered to Giolitti's electoral block. Although the alliance does have one dramatic drawback: Giolitti's coalition had often in the past contained northern organized labor. With the formation of this allaince, it's likely that block will go to the PSI this time around. Still, this won't matter if the Liberal Union is able to truly unite Catholics behind Giolitti."

ww1_italy.59.t: "The Seven Commandments of the Liberal Union"
ww1_italy.59.d: "Of course, the alliance with the Catholics has required concessions from Giolitti. After intense negotiations, the following concessions have been made:\n1: Defend liberty of conscience and association as established in the constitution and therefore oppose any bill inspired by hatred of the religious congregations, or which intends to the religious tranquality of the nation\n2: Support the principle that with the increase and development of the public school system, there will not be any attempts to discredit the work of private institutions whose work was to be considered an important factor in the elevation and diffusion of national culture\n3: Remove any uncertainty about the legal right of parents to have their children provided with religious instruction in the public schools\n4: Resist any attempt to weaken the family unit and hence absolutely oppose divorce\n5: Recognize the equality of economic and social organizations before the law, irrespective of the social or religious principles which inspired such organizations\n6: Advocate gradual but continuous reforms in fiscal matters in the sense of an increased application of the principle of social justice\n7: Uphold a policy which is intended to conserve and reinvigorate the economic and moral forces of the country, increasing Italian influence in the development of international civilization."

Not as good as we wanted, but enough for us to avoid a deadlocked parliament - at least we hope. The leftist union forced us to endorse numerous socialists to try and block right wingers from winning seats, causing the number of socialists in parliament to nearly double. While the socialists are on theory our friend, on paper we know our partnership is quite temporary, and it's likely they will withdraw their support from our government within a few years. Radicals also performed well, defending many seats down south and helping to block catholics from reaching a significant number of members in parliament, although they still managed to gain a few seats. Overall, and perhaps dissapointingly to Giolitti, the biggest losers this election seemed to be the center left and center right. While a lot of Giolitti's center right opposition fell, some of his center left supporters fell as well and were replaced by socialists and radicals, making him uncomfortable for obvious reasons."

It's been compared to the difference between the national assembly and the national convention during the French Revolution: the members of the new Italian parliament are generall younger, less cautious, and more polarized. It's leading to many PM's across different parties to reject Giolitti's trasformismo, as many feel alienated by the constant backroom backstabbing and contradictionary deals of the last 2 years under Giolitti. In addition, there's a lot more socialists and nationalists than in the previous parliament, and despite attempting to work with both groups, they've proven to be a bit... stubborn. With them now making up around 1/5th of parliament, it certainly makes things harder."

Ettore Sacchi today announced his party would be leaving Giolitti's political alliance and would no longer be supporting his government. This is a devastating blow to Giolitti's government, who had relied on high levels of support from the radical party. While Giolitti does now have strong support from catholics, it's not clear if his government will be able to survive this defeat."

Nationalists and socialists smell blood, conservatives are reconsidering their alliance with Giolitti, and even some liberals think he's betrayed their values with his pact with the catholic electoral union. This has led to his support across Italy's parliament to begin to collapse, and Giolitti's beginning to see the writing on the wall. Giolitti has had 3 cabinets already, and he's quite confident he can make another political comeback at a later date, thus he is considering a resignation. This would allow him to save face by avoiding a vote of no confidence brought on by extremist parties, but some allies of Giolitti, and the king himself, wish for him to stay for the time being.

One day Giolitti is making key pledges to industrialist business men and the next day he is promoting municipal socialism in the north. Both sides are increasingly disillusioned with a man who they see as completely unrealiable. The Italian public is also angry as they feel Giolitti is corrupt and not trustable.

Thus, he reached out to Turati to form a electoral alliance between the socialists, radicals, and Giolitti's liberals. The formation of this all leftist union has outraged catholics and conservatives, who feel Giolitti may be irredeemable now. However, the electoral alliance does make Giolitti's prospects in the next election very strong.

ww1_italy.126.d: "With protectionism leading to Italian domestic companies increasing their sales, Italian companies stock shares have been soaring. Up 8% in just a few weeks, many investors seem to be predicting that Italian companies will be seeing a dramatic increase in sales, production, and scale in the next few years."
ww1_italy.126.a: "Great"
ww1_italy.127.t: "Italian Economy Recalibrates to Tarriff Policy"
ww1_italy.127.d: "Although tariffs lead to a increase in prices on several goods across Italy at first, it seems prices have started to stabilize and even come down as Italian companies adapt to the new economic situation. This is helping to alievate some of the pain that has been felt on poorer regions of Italy from our protectionist policy."
ww1_italy.127.a: "Told you!"
ww1_italy.128.t: "Extreme Poverty in the South"
ww1_italy.128.d: "After our many tarriffs against agricultural goods, many farmers are now unable to sell their products in other countries, which rendered them into extreme poverty."
ww1_italy.128.a: "Interesting"
ww1_italy.136.t: "Fall of Tripoli"
ww1_italy.136.d: "Our forces have managed to capture the important Libyan city of Tripoli. Surpisingly, the locals did not consider us their savior or liberator, rather a colonial invading force and oppressors."
ww1_italy.136.a: "Propaganda time!"
ww1_italy.137.t: "The Ray of Hope"
ww1_italy.137.d: "For a long time, impoverished workers up north have felt forgotten about. Abandoned. At best, they were a tool for the liberal establishment type like Giolitti to exploit for political capital, and at worst brutally repressed by bourgeois aligned governments in Rome. With our new administration, many workers up north who have felt forgotten about are finally getting a hint of optimism. Hopes are high the socialists will finally be able to bring real change to them. Bring them real control over the means of production. Bring them fair and deserved pensions. Stop their bourgeois employers from repressing their right to organize."
ww1_italy.137.a: "We do it for people like them!"

ww1_red_italy.1.t: "Socialist Revolt in Torino"
ww1_red_italy.1.d: "Socialists, angered at the current domestic situation, have offically taken up arms. In Torino, workers have seized factories, weapons, and fought back against police attempting to restore order. They've declared an indepedent commune and are now waging outright war against our government."
ww1_red_italy.1.a: "We will crush these traitors"
ww1_red_italy.1.b: "Italians have reached class consciousness!"
ww1_red_italy.2.t: "Revolution Spreads to Milano!"
ww1_red_italy.2.d: "Workers inspired by their comrades in Torino have raided armouries across Milano and declared their support for the rebellion. The revolution is rapidly spreading, and will only gain more and more steam."

ww1_red_italy.2.b: "The situation continues to spiral"

ww1_red_italy.3.t: "Revolutionary Wave Sweeps the North"
ww1_red_italy.3.d: "All across the north, workers are joining the socialist rebellion. As soldiers march into their cities to attempt to enforce martial law, the anger of the workers only grows. It seems like the socialist rebellion is starting to get enough strength and support to truly have a shot at overthrowing the government."

The south remains in the exploited state that it has been under for a millenium and the integration of citizens under the Austrian umbrella has proven quite the challenge. These issues that permeate our relatively new state need to be addressed. In fact, they should have been addressed a decade ago, at the turn of the century, or even five decades ago, on the momentum of the Risorgimento. No matter, the time  remains ripe to transform the nation in order to meet a changing world. \n\nShatter the outdated standards of old! Bring a new industrial revolution to our southern kin!

ITA_leftist_union_desc: "The Radical party used to be in a similar position the PSI currently finds itself in. Many of their members refused to participate in governments and elections all together, until the early 1900's. As we brought them into government, the party natually moderated itself, with the radicals no longer holding the view that the monarchy should be abolished, for example. We must bring the PSI into a coalition, and repeat the same process that moderated the radical party."
ITA_the_reality_of_war: "The Realities of War"
ITA_the_reality_of_war_desc: "Many people in the country, including socialists, don't support the Italian involvement in Turkish Libya. As the war progresses for longer, socialist sentiment in the country will continue to rise and support for the war will start to decline as the population question our ability to achieve victory in this war against the Sick Man of Europe."
ITA_libyan_war_desc: "The inevitable war has finally broken done. Italia stands more united then ever with a patriotic fever running through the country. A patriotic fever so large, some are calling it 'dangerous'. With emotions at an all time high, we need to deliver results, both to humilate Turkey and to avoid being humilated to our own people. After all, socialists have claimed this war is completly useless and will only be a blood bath. We must prove them wrong. Unfortunately, the longer the war goes on the more correct they will appear."
ITA_war_preperations: "War Preperations"
ITA_war_preperations_desc: "Despite what our propaganda says, very few people in the higher ups of the Italian military and political office believe a war with Turkey will truely be a cakewalk. We're favored, yes, but ego would certainly be our downfall here. That's why Giolitti has ordered for war preperations to be made before we strike the Ottoman Empire. We want to ensure we are ready, but waiting too long will only anger nationalists further, who want an invasion as soon as possible."

ww1_italy.365.d: "A couple of days ago, the Ottomans have recieved a declaration of war from Rome and has been at war with our neighbor ever since. It is time for us to enter the situation and deescalate the situation, as both fighting powers can be considered our allies."

ITA_build_medusa_class_submarines_desc: "Submarine engineer Cesare Laurenti has recently made a new submarine design, the Medusa Class. The new design is a significant step forward from the previous Foca design he made, the first Italian submarine design which is quite outdated now with it's petrol engine. We should get to work building these new submarines, as they are much better and are the next step for our navy."
ITA_build_indominito_class_destroyers: "Construct Indominito Class Destroyers" 
ITA_build_indominito_class_destroyers_desc: "The Indominito Class is a new destroyer design made by engineer Luigi Scaglia. These new ships are much larger and more advanced in many ways, with it's steam turbine instead of a steam engine and will be our first large destroyers when we finish building them."

ITA_build_the_dante_alighieri_desc: "Engineer Edoardo Masdea has made a dreadnought design, the Dante Alighieri class. When finished it will be the first Italian dreadnought, a great achievement for our navy, being a display of our naval power. We should finish up the construction of the ship, and get it with out on the seas with the rest of our Regia Marina."
ITA_build_conte_di_cavour_class: "Build Modern Dreadnoughts"
ITA_build_conte_di_cavour_class_desc: "As European powers are racing to build the most dreadnoughts, we need to catch up if our navy is to stand a chance. A new dreadnought design, the Conte di Cavour class has been made by engineer Edoardo Masdea. The new design has more armour and guns then the Dante Alighieri and is intended to be superior to the dreadnought designs of other European powers."

ITA_train_new_naval_officers: "Train New Naval Officers"
ITA_train_new_naval_officers_desc: "Our navy is expanding a lot, and currently requires many more new naval officers to be properly staffed. With our new experience with modern ships, we should train modern officers who will know how to perfectly operate these recent innovations, such as submarines and dreadnoughts."
ITA_develop_new_hydrophones: "Develop New Hydrophones"
ITA_develop_new_hydrophones_desc: "Submarines are deadly vessels that pose a significant threat to our larger ships as they can be completely hidden and and strike a killing blow. Our current anti-submarine technology currently isn't great at detecting submarines and it's crucial we invest more into the development of more precise hydrophone technology."
ITA_organized_naval_barrages: "Organized Naval Barrages"
ITA_organized_naval_barrages_desc: "With the development of our modern fire control systems, we can much more precisely target our large guns at enemy ships and strike devestating blows.

ITA_free_trade_decat: "The Wonders of Free Trade"
ITA_free_trade_decat_desc: "Italy has historically used large tariff walls to shield its industries from foreign countries. While it has allowed for limited domestic industrial growth and a high employment level, its clear the policy has weakened Italy. Thus, as we work towards opening our country towards the world, we will have to be careful not to disrupt our economy too much. If foreign goods flood our country, local businesses and farmers may be forced to shut down, spiking unemployment. High unemployment will cause factory output debuffs, a political power debuff, and higher consumer goods. If foreign industries begin overwhelming domestic industries, domestic industries may begin shutting down, weaking our core industrial base. This will lead to lower stability, a political power debuff, and a construction debuff."

ww1_italy.151.d: "As we advance in the desert, Libyan natives have begun to wage guerilla warfare as an attempt to resist conquest.

ww1_italy.279.t: "Towards the End of the Normalization of Socialism"
ww1_italy.279.d: "Both Giolitti and Luzzatti worked extensively with the PSI to mantain the stability of their governments. Giolitti in particular, with his policy of trasformismo, significantly shifted the overton window on the socialist question from socialists being seen as radical and irrelevant outsiders to being a normalized part of the Italian political system with heavy say in the state of affairs. While a respectable statemen, this has been the most damaging part of Giolitti's reign, and one we must work towards fixing."
ww1_italy.279.a: "The socialists must not be accepted!"
ww1_italy.280.t: "The Line goes Dead"
ww1_italy.280.d: "Representatives from the CGL, Italy's largest labor unions, have enjoyed close cooperation with Italian governments of the last 10 years. With a regional strike spiraling, members of the CGL reached out to the Italian government expecting us to help mediate the issue in their favor. Unlike the governments of the past, however, Salandra has refused to assist them. The strike continues, although the striking workers can't go on forever..."

ww1_italy.148.d: "We've recieved word from the ambassador in Vienna that Austria wants us to wrap up the war in Libya as soon as possible, stating concerns about the stability of Europe. While not an ultimatum, it's clear they're trying to gain German and possibly British support for an eventual ultimatum. Thus, we will need to wrap up the war quickly before any sort of peace intervention can be made.\n\nThat is, unless, the French are willing to back us. Germany may be more then willing to help Austria and Turkey with a peace intervention if there's no risk to Germany, but with French pressure, we may be able to stop any peace coalition in its tracks."
ww1_italy.148.a: "Let's reach out to them, then."
ww1_italy.149.t: "France Backs us"
ww1_italy.149.d: "Lucky for us, France has published a statement urging Turkey to surrender Libya to us, and offering us their full support if any war were to break out with Austria. This essentially means any Austrian attempts to force a peace deal on us are void, although if the war drags out for years our hand may be forced anyways."
ww1_italy.149.a: "Send them our thanks"
ww1_italy.150.t: "France Offers no Support"
ww1_italy.150.d: "Our attempts to get French backing for the war in Libya have failed. Frances ambassador has informed us that while they will not join any attempt to force a peace deal, they can make no commitments of diplomatic support if one was formed by Austria. This is quite the blow, and means we will have to speed the war up. "

With our more business-friendly trade and regulatory policies, however, industries up north are once again beginning to see growth. New small businesses are popping up as the laws become friendlier towards their development, and larger foreign enterprises have begun to invest in Italy, where the previous trade laws made foreign investment practically impossible."

ww1_italy.312.d: "Since the late 1800's Italy has leveraged very high tariffs on our (and the world's)  goods. This was mainly to strengthen Italy's domestic industry, and while it has protected local manufacturers in Italy, it's led to unusually expensive goods in Italian markets and a devastated south. Seeing that their tariff strategy is no longer working, they've reached out to us for talks. In response to Italy's tariffs on our goods, we've placed our own very high tariffs on Italian agricultural products, which has devastated their farmer's exports. They wish to seek an agreement that if we lower tariffs on their goods, they will lower tariffs on ours."

Democratic socialists, maximalists, and communists have all opposed our attempts to transform Italy's government from a parliament making legislative decisions to a collection of unions making them. We do have the authority to call new elections, but we must time these new elections properly. By passing popular legislation and ensuring economic recovery continues strong, we can ensure a syndicalist majority in parliament, allowing us to truly transform Italy into a workers nation."

While all leftists are welcome to run, we must decide the fate of the bourgeois. Obviously, outright monarchist parties will be banned, but we must decide what to do with capitalist parties. Some believe we would be hypocrites if we banned capitlist parties, who do enjoy support from a large percentage of Italians, as it would make our political system no more democratic then the autocratic monarchy of old. Others believe that banning capitalist parties is not anti-democratic at all since capitlist parties being elected would inevitably result in the oppression of all Italian workers and citizens, and that true freedom and democracy comes from economic freedom and a democratic workplace, which we will no doubt provide."

The anarchists moved to arm themself and the two sides exchanged gun fire. Anarchists sucessfully forced the police to retreat, and a indepedent commune has been declared.

With only 4 other countries having achieved such a monumental reform, Italy's sure to be on the right side of history."

Many centrist members are hardly convinced by this argument, being more swayed by Giolittis idea of cautious expansaion of the electorate as Italians education and literacy increases.

ww1_italy.169.d: "As a great power, Italy deserves a sphere of influence, and the Balkans are the perfect place to build one. The problem, however, lies in the fact that our Austrian allies completely dominate the Balkans as of currently. Holding immense economic influence over the Balkans, Austria currently has large leverage over them. a leverage that the Balkan countries are well aware of, making many of them uncomfortable. Thus, we have the chance to offer the Balkans a way out: partnership with Italy. We can offer Balkan countries moderate sized investments in their country in an attempt to sway them away from Vienna and help tie our economies together."

With Italy's parliament deeply polarized and no politicians able to or wanting to take the mantle of Prime Minister, Emmanuel has taken drastic action. Current chief of staff Pollio, a moderate conservative, has been offered the role of Prime Minister. Although lacking some support in parliament, the king's unexpected appointment of a military offical to the spot of prime minister has spooked most of parliament, who fear a return to the days of Italy's authoritarianism under Crispi, into supporting Pollio rather then risking a possible persecution.

Quite different from Emmanuel, Umberto was very active in politics mananging much of the country's foreign policy and heavily influencing his puppet PM's to do his bidding.

While many glorify the days of the Roman empire, they have few nice things to say about Italy in its current state, maybe justifiably so. Firmly in the third rank of European powers, Italy has earned little respect across the world. Being given a pitiful piece of land in the Horn of Africa after being denied repeatably its actual claims, losing a war to Ethiopia, and having a military hardly better then the decaying Turkish empire are just a few examples of Italy's weakness on the world stage, and you'll often here the loudest critics of Italy coming from the nationalists. The call for radical change to make an Italy able to achieve the glory it deserves. Militarism, anti liberalism, and an aggressive foreign policy are all points you'll hear nationalists make. Assuming nothing dramatic changes, we can expect nationalist circles who claim to love Italy continue to insult it more then any so called “unpatriotic“ liberal would."

The north, while not exactly Paris or London, lives in relative luxury, certainly living more lavishly then someone in Warsaw or Sofia. The south is, however, home to some of the poorest in Europe. Only living moderately better then Russian peasants, Italian farmers down south have been crushed by the North-focused policies of previous Italian governments, and left plundered by the practically colonial level treatment of southern farmlands for the benefit of the North. While many try to live their lives, holding bitter resentment, many have decided to flee the country. Most prevalent in the 1880's, millions of Italians have left to other countries - particularly the American east coast. While emmigration has slowed down, it's still very much ongoing in the South. This has led to a variety of issues - certainly our ego has been bruised by this, but the economics of losing millions of people certainly aren't helping Italy right now either."

Thus, they would go backrupt and have their very way of life ruined.\n\nSuprisingly, Italian nationalists have used these farmers as a rallying point, using the farmers as examples of every day Italians who will have their life dramatically worsened by the reduction of tariffs.

ww1_italy.286.d: "When nationalist writers across Italy were attempting to rally support for a war with the Ottoman Empire, they often claimed that Libya would be a gold mine for Italy - both literally and metaphorically. Italians were promised an abundence of natural resources, friendly locals, and cheap fancy homes on the warm Libyan coast. With Libya having been under our control for nearly half a year at this point, it's clear these ideas were nothing more then a fantasy. On the contrary to having a large supply of natural resoures, Libya is becoming a drain on the economy. Natives are waging a brutal guerilla war, and Italians are more interested in moving to Chicago than experiencing Libyan carnage in Tripoli."

ww1_italy.53.t: "Democratic Socialists Remain Control over the PSI"
ww1_italy.53.d: "In a sigh of relief for the Giolitti government, democratic and pro Giolitti socialists have managed to beat out a challenge from the maximalists. Maximalists have already began splitting off from the PSI and declaring the formation of their own party, although it hasn't seen much success. With the PSI remaining reformist, it open the opprotunity to Giolitti to secure a electoral alliance containing them, as he generally prefers them to the catholic block."
ww1_italy.53.a: "Thank god"
ww1_italy.74.t: "Mass Expulsions of pro Giolitti Socialists from the PSI"
ww1_italy.74.d: "A large number of socialists have been kicked out of the PSI for their support of Giolitti, who has seen his favorbility ratings with the public plummet after the disaster in Libya. Their socialists, claim the maximalists who have been leading the clense of the party, are revisionists who betrayed the workers of Italy by supporting their liberal oppressor. These expulsions have seen a dramatic increase in power by the maximalists, who have seen their anti Giolitti rhetoric earn them more support amongst the Italian public."
ww1_italy.75.t: "ANI Party Grow Significantly"
ww1_italy.75.d: "The originally small ANI has seen its members and strength skyrocket as the party has been running a highly successful anti Giolitti campaign, claiming under their leadership the Libyan disaster would never have happened. Their extreme nationalism as well as anti corruption rhetoric has made their message appear very inspiring to the Italian people - a people tired of the constant loses and embarassment on the world stage that the Kingdom of Italy has faced in it's recent history. They're seeing their movement go from a small, niche movement to rapidly becoming one of the largest organized parties in Europe. With this, it's expected they will capture a fair sjare of Italy's parliament seats come the next election - at least at the current rate of their growth."
ww1_italy.75.a: "No need to worry, we can simply use trasformismo on them."
ww1_italy.74.a: "Ha! They're tearing themselves apart"
ww1_italy.71.t: "The Greatest Disaster"
ww1_italy.71.d: "There's no other way to spin it: what happened in Libya was a disaster, probably the greatest disaster in the young kingdoms entire history. What was promised to be a cake walk ended up becoming a humiliating slog that ended in Italy's loss. Thousands have been lost in a war that was managed utterly disastrously by Giolitti.\n\nBoth socialists and nationalists have their own explanation for what went wrong. The socialists are claiming, despite many of them initially  being supportive of the war, that they knew the conflict was always a bad idea - an imperialist adventure over a piece of sand that would have brought no benefit to the common Italian people. The war, they are claiming, was brought on to Giolitti by the interests of big business who intend to use the colony and it's people as a tool to exploit to enrich themselves.\n\nThe nationalists claim the war was completely winnable, if the weak liberal leadership of Giolitti was run by someone stronger, someone who truly loved Italy and wasn't held back by degenerate and liberal values, as well as someone who didn't give into the demanmds of Europes other great powers. Demands that hindered Italy's ability to wage the war.\n\nWith such a resounding defeat after patriotic emotions being so high, many Italians can't help but to be swayed by one of these explanations. Both nationalists and socialists have seen their support begin to skyrocket lately."
ww1_italy.71.a: "Extremely worrying!"
ww1_italy.72.t: "They Told you so!"
ww1_italy.72.d: "The PSI can't help but to remind the Italian people: we warned you the war was not a good idea. For months, much of the PSI waged a anti war campaign, warning the conflict would result in thousands of Italians losing their lives for no benefit to the people. And they were more right then they ever could have predicted. With loses in the thousands, the only thing Italy has to show for it is war reparations to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Many Italians have found themselves swayed by the PSI rhetoric - they were right here, the war was a complete disaster. Maybe they're right about the need for dramatic economic reforms across the country too?"
ww1_italy.72.a: "Oh come on, many of you supported the war!"
ww1_italy.73.t: "The Clearest Case for the Failures of Liberalism"
ww1_italy.73.d: "The Risorgimento was supposed to lead to a new golden age for Italy, one where it would be respected abroad and cement itself as a great player in European politics. What's the actual results? Losing 2 wars to nations in which we had significant advantaged over. Twice, liberals have completely blown it when it mattered most. Because of liberals lack of love for Italy, it's refusal to escalate wars in fear of the great powers of Europe, and the corruption of liberal governments, Italy has been completely humiliated on the world stage twice in a row. Only through strong leadership, anti corruption, and nationalism can Italy hope to fufill the ideas of Risorgimento."
ww1_italy.73.a: "Liberty should be cherished by all Italians!"
ww1_italy.54.t: "International Pressure"
ww1_italy.54.d: "Our navy has clashed with the Ottoman navy in the Central Mediterranean Sea near the port of Preveza, in Greece. It seems this has caused quite the international reaction, as we're recieving demands from Austria, Russia, and Greece to limit our naval activities in the Balkans and to ensure the war does not spread into a regional conflict. This has outraged the nationalists, who are calling on Italy to reject the international pressure and do whatever operations in the war it pleases."
ww1_italy.54.a: "Whatever"
ww1_italy.55.t: "Austro-Italian Incident at sea"
ww1_italy.55.d: "Today, our coastal defenses open fired and sunk an enemy vessel. At least, that's what we thought happened. It turns out we accidently sunk an Austrian vessel instead. The Austrians are completely outraged, and we can expect a response from them soon."
ww1_italy.55.a: "Jesus Christ! This is completely their fault"
ww1_italy.56.t: "[AUS.GetName] Demands an Apology"
ww1_italy.56.d: "The Austrians have sent a formal demand to our government that we apologize to them for the accidental sinking of one of their ships. In addition, they are demanding that we 'avoid further escalation' of the war with the Ottomans, that we are under no circumstances to annex land from or expand the war to the Balkans, and that we are to limit our naval action in general."
ww1_italy.56.a: "Those Bastards! We have no choice..."
ww1_italy.47.t: "Sifting Through the Files"
ww1_italy.47.d: "Giolitti sat at this desk, pondering to to convince parliament to pass his upcoming male suffrage bill. He'd plan to propose it soon, but there was a real force of opposition on the right. He knew what to do, though. Giolitti got out his files that he had on every member of parliament. For every single member of parliament, Giolitti kept a small file about them: their weaknesses. Giolitti has always been a master at manipulation, and he often credited it to these files. He looked through the opposition, one by one he started formulating a plan to manipulate key PM's into falling into line. He wasn't worried anymore. He'd get it done."
ww1_italy.47.a: "He's had 3 cabinets already for a reason, after all."
ww1_italy.46.t: "Mantaining a Friendly Socialist Party"
ww1_italy.46.d: "The PSI has elected to, for the last 3 Giolitti cabinets, to not stand in strong opposition to him. It seems they have voted to do the same this time around. The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There is leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists takeover the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their withdraw from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."
ww1_italy.46.a: "Let's hope they stick to their senses, then."
ww1_italy.40.t: "Not 'Liberators' After all..."
ww1_italy.40.d: "Our troops and even Giolitti himself were under the, in hindsight rather naive, assumption that Italian troops would be welcomed with parades and gifts of home cooked meals by the locals of Libya, who desperately awaited for Italian troops to liberate them. This has turned out to be completely wrong however, as Libyan locals are just as resistant to Italian liberation as they are to Ottoman oppression. We've seen little to no local cooperation against the Ottoman Empire in Libya. If anything, the locals seem to prefer the turks to us."
ww1_italy.40.a: "We're doing whats best for them, even if they don't understand it!"
ww1_italy.35.t: "Business Owners Request Meditation in Strikes"
ww1_italy.35.d: "There's been a dramatic increase in strike up north which is slowing down our industry. It comes as the socialist party drifts further and further towards revolutionary rhetoric as it intends to bring change through force instead of through the democratic system. These increases in strikes are leading to northern business owners to call on us to intervene, and favor employers in strike negotiations."
ww1_italy.35.a: "Restricting their right to strike will only anger them further"
ww1_italy.35.b: "We can certainly play a role in these strike negotiations"
ww1_italy.36.t: "'No Justice, No Peace' vs 'a Revolution From the Ballot Box'"
ww1_italy.36.d: "There's been a debate amongst socialist circles lately on just how reformable Italian democracy is. There's an increasing sentiment of refusing to make peace with a system seen as unfixable. With Italies current electoral system for example, only a fraction of Italians - generally more well off then the average Italian - are the ones who vote. How are socialists supposed to win in this rigged system?\n\nOn the other side, however, the more moderate reformists in the PSI still believe democracy is far from irredeemable. It has its issues, yes, but the sort of violent and anti democratic rhetoric from the maximalists is far from the solution. They instead coin the idea of a 'revolution from the ballot box' in which Italians will eventually wake up from the oppressions of capitalism and give them at least a major say in the make up of Italy's parliament, in which they will pass suffrage reform and thus secure an electoral mandate for years to come."
ww1_italy.36.a: "How can you claim to represent the people without accepting democracy"
ww1_italy.36.b: "The current laws of Italy make socialists legally being elected impossible!"
ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists in recent years. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. Some nationalists have indeed been calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of nationalist seperatists, unstable politics, and a neglected army. These texts are increasingly swaying Italians towards the idea of a war with Libya - an idea that was struggling to break out of fringe nationalist circles but increasingly gaining support."
ww1_italy.20.a: "That certainly sounds nice!"
ww1_italy.22.t: "A Divided Party"
ww1_italy.23.t: "Failed Anti-War Strike"
ww1_italy.23.d: "Several anti-war socialists have attempted to organize national opposition towards a war with Turkey. Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary, as such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Besides, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. Why waste political capital to oppose something that will probably never happen."
ww1_italy.23.a: "Only time will tell."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to have our interests at heart. Austria is actively oppressing Italians in its borders, and the French have shown no respect for our legitimate claims in Africa and elsewhere. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be sought from this is that Italy needs to grow stronger, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."
ww1_italy.19.a: "Not a bad idea."
ww1_italy.18.t: "La Guerra Lontana"
ww1_italy.21.t: "The Socialist Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.21.d: "The increasing public demand for a war to conquer Libya has come as a great suprise to the left. In their eyes, the issue was over with. Settled years ago in the Congress of Berlin. With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, have began denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression. A war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of minority being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialsist to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to tear a rift amongst socialists in Italy."
ww1_italy.22.a: "The socialist party is anti war at heart, no?"
ww1_italy.22.b: "Nationalistic socialists huh? Interesting"
ww1_italy.21.a: "Don't let them distract you from your real issues!"
ww1_italy.18.d: "The influencial Italian writer Corradini has recently published a new book promoting Italian nationalism and expansionism. In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with the sick man of Europe: The Ottoman Empire. With the Ottomans being so weak, surely Libya would be easy pickings, right?"
ww1_italy.18.a: "La Guerra Vittoriosa!"
ww1_italy.17.t: "Formation of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana"
ww1_italy.17.d: "Today, hundreds of journalists, literary figures, and educators gathered in florence to create a new political movement, the ANI. This group has characterized itself as an ultra nationalist and expanionist group who intends to promote the expansion of Italy into various different territories. In particular, the group seems interested in Libya. They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia. The group has began publications across Italy to rally people to the cause of Italiah expansionism, and it's having its effect. More and more people are beginning to support colonial wars, with Libya being an especially popular target."
ww1_italy.17.a: "They really do have a few points..."
ww1_italy.15.t: "Mantaining Government Stability"
ww1_italy.15.d: "Luzzatti's government fell apart because he did not a base political support from any faction in Italy's parliament, but Giolitti is no novice to Italian politics. Already serving 3 terms as prime minister, he knows how to carefully and strategically align and isolate political factions whenever needed. With his 4th mandate secured, he'll need to keep enough support from MP's in Italy's parliament to ensure his governments survival."
ww1_italy.15.a: "It's what Giolitti does best!"
ww1_italy.14.t: "The Return of Giolitti"
ww1_italy.14.d: "Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. With Luzzatti's weak leadership failing to consolidate a base of support, and an impending vote of no confidence, Luzzatti has resigned to avoid an embarassing ousting. Who will run the next government? Giolitii, of course. It was always going to be Giolitii. No other Italian politician has nearly as much influence and support as him. With him easily securing the Prime Minister slot, time will tell how his 4th cabinet ends up."
ww1_italy.14.a: "He won't have it easy..."
ww1_italy.13.t: "Breakneck Industrialization"
ww1_italy.13.d: "It is no secret that our status as a great power lies with the north, not the south. The duchies and republics that made Northern Italy their home were able to consolidate and advance to greater heights because of the relative peace. The predecessor to our nation, Sardinia-Piedmont, is such an example.\n\nThe south has, in contrast, laid in a state of disrepair for over a thousand years, exploited by the Arabs, the French, and the Spaniards. It is a shame to say our current policies do much of the same.\n\nAll these pieces of history have shaped the way Italy is today: from the top down. The problem is, the wealth never trickles down, it only flows to the north. It is a price we must bear as a nation, yet only one part does so. Our industrial might shall remain concentrated in Turin, Milan, and the Venetian countryside for as long as this remains. It does not look like it will change anytime soon, but that is just another sad story in the annals of the history of our peninsula."

ww1_italy.9.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.9.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass came as several center right legislators flipped against the bill - enough so to stop it from passing."
ww1_italy.9.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.8.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Proposed to Parliament "
ww1_italy.8.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. The right has put up a unified front against the bill, and they're swaying many centrists. "
ww1_italy.8.a: "Ride or die!"
ww1_italy.7.t: "Death of the Mandate"
ww1_italy.7.d: "With our failure to pass electoral reform, it seems our mandate - and government, are toast. The centrists want Giolitti back, the catholics want a new conservative prime minister, the socialists were never never going to support us, neither were the far right. With pretty much every faction of the government wanting us gone, it's basically inevitable the government will be pushed out by a vote of no confidence soon, unless we resign before then."
ww1_italy.6.t: "Universal Male Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.6.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass can be mostly blamed on the socialists, who refused to vote for the bill as they saw the bill as not going far enough."

ww1_italy.5.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Male Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. There are worries that some on the far left or right may try to rally against the bill. "

ww1_italy.1.t: "Giolitti's Support"
ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Luzzatti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."
ww1_italy.1.a: "We'll need to perfect the balancing act"
ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. A lot of the power base of the PSI comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to their demands. Still though, it's hard to argue our recent overtures to the PSI have been useless. We have indeed secured a small base of support from their party to our upcoming agenda."
ww1_italy.2.a: "The radicals are putting politics over the people!"
ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysis are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country, catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists see him as weak, at best, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a no confidence vote, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a no confidence vote, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."

ww1_italy.10.d: "Italian nationalists have long wanted to build a colonial empire, however Italy proved to be too weak to secure it's deserved chunk of Africa. The press, however, has began pushing for a war with the Ottomans to secure Libyan, with an earnest response from their readers. They claim Libya is full of natural resources and a population pleading for Italian liberation, being defended by a measly 4 thousand soldiers. Word of mouth proves quite capable too, with whispers being exchanged in parliament about how capturing Libya would be a walk in the park. It would be quite the treat if those whispers proved true, but you can never know until you try."

The both also understand working with eachother can have mutual benefits for themselves and the country. However, Giolitti's recent policies of municipal socialism has lead to great anger amongst them. These policies are cutting deeply into their profits and causing business growth to slow down.

ww1_italy.25.d: "The Ottoman ambassador to Rome, with the backing of Vienna, have sent a last minute offer to Italy's government. Essentially, they are prepared to give us everything we want. In exchange for recognizing Ottoman suzerainty over Libya, they will simply hand us control over Libya. Recognizing  Ottoman suzerainty over Libya would change pretty much nothing. We'd control the territory, the resources, the laws, everything. Our soldiers would garison it. It would simply be ours in every defacto way.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this war is not just for Libya, its to rally Italy's political sphere to support Giolitti. Nationalists are increasingly becoming an influencial faction, and a war would easily gain their support. In addition, a war would surely have a rally around the flag effect and would allow Giolitti support of pretty much everyone, even for a temporary time."

While a protectorate won't hurt Italy, Italy could have gotten so much more. A full annexation of Libya, war reperations, hell Albania were all on the table.

It seems a liberal-catholic alliance is not crazy at all, at least not as crazy as you would think it to be 10 years ago, as alliances between catholics and liberals have been popping up in at the local level in Turin, Florence, and Venice. They ally together in part because of fear from socialists and ultra nationalists. With this, Giolitti has been looking at somehow expanding these local alliances at the national level."

Thus, the nationalists have shifted towards claiming credit for starting the war in the first place. They claim Giolitti only started the war out of a pressure campaign from the nationalists.

However, it seems Turati has calculated that cooperation with Giolitti is becoming less and less politically viable. With extremist maximalists becoming a greater force in the Italian political sphere, calculating working with Giolitti only serves to anger them, and fracture the party, Turati has been less and less open to working with Giolitti. Thus, Giolitti's overtures to Turati have been increasingly rebutted, as Turati seeks to mantain the unity of his party."

Indeed, Giolitti did take the opposite stance on the issue then the one he has been parading as of late, however Giolitti has presented his own argument to them on why Italy is ready for the expansion of the electorate. He's argued that Italy is much more educated and has much higher literacy rates then it did just 20 years ago, with education helping to build a 'regime of liberty'. Giolitti has, depending on who you ask either boldly or delusionally, claimed that Italy's working class will not be swayed by 'lunatucs'. He argued that the general masses are smarter then given credit for, and that as labor conditions improve through labor action, socialism will gradually decline in Italy. He certainly isn't swaying any conservatives with his arguments, but some of the old guard liberals are starting to come around."

ww1_italy.29.d: "Giolitti has always been a master of the art of trasformismo. Isolating and allying whatever factions of Italy that make sense for his current ambitions. This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with.

In fact, our recent successes have made nationalsists so sure that we are curb stomping the Ottoman Empire, they are calling for us to expand the war. They specifically call for us to make naval landings in Albania and kick the Ottoman garrison out, which could cause mass revolts across the Turkish balkans and lead to a collapse of their empire in that region. It would deal a unrecoverable blow to Turkey and also secure us Albania.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this notion is completely infeasable. Our limited naval actions around Albania themself have caused mass protests from Greece, Russia, and Austria, who have threatened us into drawing back.

We've been eyeing up the Dodecanese for a while now, and there's been little to no protest from any country but the Greeks at our naval presense near the islands. Thus, we should be able to easily take them for ourself. It's not the prize that Albania is, but it should still help to satisfy the nationalists, and besides the island are indeed useful naval bases."

Giolitti's coalition has enjoyed a decent amount of socialist support in the past, and with support from the PSI being pretty much a done deal, Giolitii will have to look towards other coalition partners."

ww1_italy.31.t: "Socialists Distrust Giolitti's Suffrage Reform"
ww1_italy.31.d: "Full male suffrage is one of the key talking points amongst socialists, so you can imagine Giolitti's confusion when he started recieving attacsk from socialists over it. They claim Giolitti must have some sort of alternative motive with the new law. They claim he wants to insult the lower classes by ensuring would not enjoy the prestige and self-fulfillment of electing a government which granted them the right to vote. It's a nonsensical argument, but it's being met with agreement by a suprisingly large amount of socialists. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't they be greatful?"

While Giolittis standing amongst socialists is shaky, he had enjoyed some support from the more moderate members of the party. This recent gaffe has damaged his support amongst them, however, as the comment was seen as a rejection of socialism as a whole. This combined with his recent overtures to nationalist factions have resulted in him being seen increasingly see him as someone who can't be worked with in good faith."

ww1_italy.57.d: "Libya is a mostly muslim territory, as opposed to the catholic Italy. Many in the Catholic Church want to work towards converting Libya to Christianity, but Giolitti has been more apprehensive to this idea.As a strong proponent of seperation between church and state, the idea of allowing the Church a free hand to do whatever they wish in Libya is worrying to him. Although, doing so would bring greater catholic support to Giolitti, which will be crucial towards mantaining his regime. "

With a polarized parliament becoming more and more resistant to trasformismo and generally distaining Giolitti's policies, his government has lost the levels of support it needs to function. With this, Giolitti has handed his resignation to the king. It's not clear who will be Giolitti's sucessor yet, but it looks like whoever gets Giolitti's endorsement will have the best shot."

Ironically, the arrest of Mussolini has only brought more attention to the maximalists, and its lead to their popularity increasing."

Giolitti's key issue however is that the left has rapidly radicalized in the last few months, and although he may be able to put an end to the strike, there's no getting rid of their anger.

The general strike is sure to nuke his popularity even further, as prices rise. He can't, however, give into their demands.

The police won the shoot out, killing at least 5 people. The PSI has been quick to denounce the shooting by the police as an unnecessary slaughter of workers exercising their right to strike and protest.

The crucial Catholic vote will help significantly with ensuring that liberals and Catholics don't end up splitting their vote up north which would lead to a socialist sweep. The alliance will also help ensure that the south is delivered to Giolitti's electoral block. Although the alliance does have one dramatic drawback: Giolitti's coalition had often in the past contained northern organized labor.

It's leading to many PM's across different parties to reject Giolitti's trasformismo, as many feel alienated by the constant backroom deals and contradictionary deals of the last 2 years under Giolitti.

The formation of this all leftist union has outraged catholics and conservatives, who feel Giolitti may be irredeemable now. However, the electoral alliance does make Giolitti's prospects in the next election very strong.

ww1_italy.51.d: "Despite showing lukewarm support for the war at first, the maximalists have quickly flip-flopped on the issue decrying the war as a massive failure of Giolitti and another reason why the PSI should refuse to work with him. Indeed, the Turkish Italian war has proven to be very unpopular amongst socialists due to it being bloodier and longer then promised. Their rallying cries have increased support for their vision in the party of no liberal cooperation, and caused some PSI MP's to flip to opposing our government."
ww1_italy.51.a: "Bastards!"
ww1_italy.95.t: "Catholic Opposition"
ww1_italy.95.d: "Catholics have been organized against socialists for years at this point, and the asscension of them into government has not been met with open arms by them. Catholics across the country are organizing resistance to the government and mobilizing people to protest anti church laws as well as organize for the next election. "
ww1_italy.95.a: "They have nothing to fear!"
ww1_italy.97.t: "Coalition Members Suggest Abolishing the Monarchy"
ww1_italy.97.d: "Members of the all-left coalition have been increasingly floating Republican ideas lately, with the majority of the coalition openly supporting the creation of a Republic. The problem is that the king is paying attention, and he's certainly not happy about it. The king has personally requested Bissolati help... get the coalition under control. Asking the coalition to tone done the rhetoric would, however, most likely cause immense anger. "
ww1_italy.97.a: "They need to tone it down"
ww1_italy.97.b: "They're free to express their opinion"
ww1_italy.96.t: "Treaty of Lausanne"
ww1_italy.96.d: "Ottoman and Italian Diplomats have met in Switzerland to dictate the end of the conflicts. Luckily, with instability in the Balkans and in the Middle East, we have the upper hand in the peace agreement."
ww1_italy.96.a: "Libya is ours!"
ww1_italy.96.b: "Let's facilitate the occupation"
ww1_italy.106.t: "Italo-Austrian Incident at Sea!"
ww1_italy.106.d: "Yesterday, the Italian coast guard sunk an Austrian vessel in the Adriatic Sea. The Italians have claimed the whole episode to be a complete accident, but it lead to an outraged Austria protesting against the Italian government and forcing them to apologize on the incident at sea. They also demand them to implement several new restrictions on the war with the Turks. They include limiting naval activity severely and pledging to end the war as quickly as possible. While the Italian government has accepted these demands, it outraged Italians who view this as foreign powers once again controlling Italy's business."
ww1_italy.106.a: "What?!"
ww1_italy.106.b: "Accident! It was an accident!"
ww1_italy.106.c: "Ok"
ww1_italy.147.t: "Womens Suffrage Achieved in Italy"
ww1_italy.147.d: "In a move mirroring the Representation of the People Act in Britain, Italy's conservatives have worked with socialists to outflank liberals from the left, and pass an ammendment to a recent male suffrage bill expanding suffrage to women. With only Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Australia currently having women able to vote, this is historic move and might represent increased momentum for womens suffrage movements world wide. Already, women in America in particular are intensifying their fight for womens suffrage, with protests being organized in France as well."
ww1_italy.147.a: "Quite the monumental feat"
ww1_italy.107.t: "Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf calls for war with the Italians"
ww1_italy.107.d: "Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, who is an anti-Italian, calls for war after the incident in the Adriatic, justifying that it would be suicidal not to use the opportunity to crush the Italians"
ww1_italy.107.a: "Nonsense, this was clearly an accident!"
ww1_italy.109.t: "Muslims Boycott Italian Goods!"
ww1_italy.109.d: "Muslims around the world in corners like in the British Raj and Africa, are boycotting Italian products and goods in order to pressure our government to stop our conquest of Libya. They say that all muslims, according to the Qur'an, are all brethren, and that therefore, all Muslims should unite to help Turkey in every possible way, including a boycott."
ww1_italy.109.a: "Better wrap up quickly"
ww1_italy.111.t: "Italian Conquest of the Dodecanese"
ww1_italy.111.d: "The Italians have successfully captured the Ottoman-owned islands of the Dodecanese. The Italian government hopes this finally pressures [TUR.GetName] into signing a peace deal in their favor. This is an event that could change the tides of this war, as the Italians are now stationned with an army less than 50 kilometers away from Mainland Anatolia."
ww1_italy.111.a: "Surprising"
ww1_italy.111.b: "They're in our backyard"
ww1_italy.111.c: "This must be the final blow!"
ww1_italy.112.t: "Italian Conquest of Rhodes"
ww1_italy.112.d: "The Italians have successfully conducted a naval invasion of Rhodes today. The Italian government hopes this finally pressures [TUR.GetName] to sign a favorable peace agreement as the Italian army has secured an island nearby Anatolia."
ww1_italy.112.a: "Wow"
ww1_italy.112.b: "How could this happen?"
ww1_italy.112.c: "It's too easy"
ww1_italy.114.t: "Confindustria Is Supporting Opposition Parties"
ww1_italy.114.d: "We've discovered that Confindustria is 100% involving themselves in Italian politics. They've been donating to and offering support ot, quite openly, right leaning canidates in preperations for Italy's elections. Now, it is within their right to do this, but some of the more... extreme members of the coalition wish to punish them anyways. We would indeed have a variety of tools to do this, but not only is it probably illegal, it would be unpopular amongst the public and amongst moderates in our coalition."
ww1_italy.114.a: "Legal or not, who gives a damn! Harass them until they stop"
ww1_italy.114.b: "Well it is within their right..."
ww1_italy.115.t: "No Evidence Confindustria is Supporting a Coup"
ww1_italy.115.d: "Some of the more conspiracy minded members of the coalition has insisted that capitalistic elitist groups like Confindustria were planning to hire a private army to march down to rome and overthrow our government. While never taken all that seriously, our investigation did look into this prospect and have found it to be nonsense. There are however, some in our coalition who have the idea to... greatly exaggerate what little we did find - talks between members of the Confindustria stating they'd much prefer a different government, and twist it into them plotting to overthrow our government, thus giving us justification to retaliate. "

ww1_italy.117.t: "Confindustria Caught Union Busting"
ww1_italy.117.d: "Members of the Confindustria obviously oppose unions as they reduce their profits. However, in our investigation we've caught the Confindustria helping stop unionization across the country through bribes and threats. Thus, we can persecute them for it. There is a question on just how far we should go, however. Moderates in the coalition wish for us to punish them to the full extent of the law and leave it at that. Extremists wish for us to use this to help dismantle the organization completely."
ww1_italy.117.a: "Dismantle these bastards!"
ww1_italy.117.b: "Persecute them to the full extent of the law!"
ww1_italy.120.t: "France and Germany Place Retaliatory Agricultural Tariffs"
ww1_italy.121.t: "Southern Farmers Suffer from Franco-German Tariffs"
ww1_italy.121.d: "Germany and Frances retaliatory tariffs on us have lead to serious pain in many southern communities. While food gets more expensive, their profits shrink. It's increased tensions and economic inequslity between the north and the south, as the south increasingly see's Romes policies as only benefiting the 'Trianglular 3' industrial cities up north, where tariffs have seen a boom in available jobs. Many in the south have even opted to flee to countries like America."
ww1_italy.121.a: "Who cares about them"
ww1_italy.119.t: "The African Sinkhole"
ww1_italy.119.d: "Colonies certainly arn't cheap. Large militaries to protect them, modernization efforts, and supressing local rebels all cost lots of money. Unfortuantely, we're simply not finding a large abundence of resources in our African holdings in the horn of Africa to make it worth it. Increasingly, more money is needed to mantain control over the colonies, and they're beginning to become sinkholes."
ww1_italy.119.a: "They will be profitable eventually!"
ww1_italy.123.t: "Higher Prices... Are Leading to a Surge in Patriotism?"
ww1_italy.123.d: "Whats more Italian then a high quality locally sourced bottle of olive oil, parmigiano reggiano made right in Parma, paired with a 2 year aged bottle of Barolo? While for awhile, Italian production of these classic Italian goods had struggled to compete with cheaper, lesser quality foreign made versions, with our recent new tariffs things are starting to swing back the other way. Italian specialities are increasingly taking back their rightful shelf space in grocerry stores comapred to their inferior foreign counterparts, and it's became quite the propaganda piece for the government. We've been able to spin this into a broader campaign of us putting Italy first, restoring Italian greatness, and co-opting nationalist sentiments in general."
ww1_italy.123.a: "We can really spin anything!"
ww1_italy.119.b: "Alas, the consequences of a free market"
ww1_italy.125.t: "'Trade Wars' Begin With Other Countries"
ww1_italy.125.d: "With tariffs being raised on several key goods, counter tariffs have been levied on us by several different countries. It's resulted in us having to make better do with what we've got, as well as both our imports and exports declining - although the former declining more then the latter. While its leading to higher prices, it's also strengthening our domestic industry and proving to be quite popular amongst nationalists."
ww1_italy.125.a: "The pros outweight the cons"
ww1_italy.124.d: "While tariffs on some key goods are inevitable with our new economic direction, theres been some limited calls from protectionist nationalists up north to implement a blanket, universal tariff on all goods entering Italy of around 5-10%. It would certainly, rapidly, result in a boost of goods being made in Italy. The downside would be a noticable increase in prices for many goods across Italy in which our domestic industry simply cannot make up for the reduced imports this would inevitably lead to. Shall we go with the idea?"
ww1_italy.124.a: "A great idea, we'll sign it immediantly!"
ww1_italy.124.b: "That sounds quite extreme"
ww1_italy.124.c: "We'll do it, but give a 6 month notice before it takes effect."
ww1_italy.118.t: "Industrial Drain from Italy"
ww1_italy.118.d: "An openly socialist government in the first place had always worried business leaders, but they had tolerated it - until now. Our investigations in Confindustria has worried business leaders, who see it as unfair and see themselves as the next victim. Many business leaders are gathering their capital and leaving Italy for other more business friendly countries."
ww1_italy.118.a: "Fine! We won't miss you capitalist pigs!"
ww1_italy.118.b: "We need to do whatever we can to reduce this"
ww1_italy.122.t: "Tariffs Attributed to Lower Unemployment Rates up North"
ww1_italy.108.t: "Radicals Propose Lower Tariffs"
ww1_italy.108.d: "Italy has oftem levied high tariffs on other countries, mainly for political reasons to gain the support of the north, while helping the north has not helped the south. It's lead to counter tariffs being placed on Italy, which has hurt the souths agricultural exports. Thus, some southern members of the radical party have proposed to Bisolatti that Italy negotiate lower tariffs with foreign countries to strengthen the south's exports. Of course, this would be unpopular in the north, but it is true Italy's tariffs are quite high and the south would benefit greatly if this went through."
ww1_italy.108.a: "No need to change the policy now"
ww1_italy.108.b: "Let's do it"
ww1_italy.122.d: "While steel has became more expensive, Italian steel manufacturers are finally able to realistically compete in the economy. Thus, many steel plants which had been at risk of shutting down have began to see a surge in business activity, with them recieving the ability to higher more and more workers. This has resulted in unemployment, which has begin to moderately rise, start to steadily decline. While of course helping the local economy, its mainly been a political victory as our government can directly claim credit for these events."
ww1_italy.122.a: "An Italian success story!"
ww1_italy.120.d: "Not taking too kindly to our blanketed tariffs on foreign grain, both Germany and France have quickly responded with counter tariffs of their own. This has lead to our exports down south facing a steep decline as the 2 countries made up a large bulk of our grain exports. Although this may help Italy become more self sufficent with food production, it will certainly make grain more expensive in the short term."
ww1_italy.120.a: "Nothing to Worry about"
ww1_italy.126.t: "Italian Companies Stocks Rise"
ww1_italy.126.d: "With protectionism leading to Italian domestic companies increasing their sales, Italian companies stock shares have been soaring. Up 8% in just a few weeks, many investors seem to be predicting that Italian companies will be seeing a dramatic increase in sales, production, and scale in the new few years."
ww1_italy.126.a: "Great"
ww1_italy.127.t: "Italian Economy recalibrates to tarriff policy"
ww1_italy.127.d: "Insert text here"
ww1_italy.127.a: "Told you!"
ww1_italy.128.t: "Extreme Poverty in the South"
ww1_italy.128.d: "After our many tarriffs against agricultural goods, many farmers are now unable to sell their products in other countries, which rendered them into extreme poverty."
ww1_italy.128.a: "Interesting"
ww1_italy.136.t: "Fall of Tripoli"
ww1_italy.136.d: "Our forces have managed to capture the important Libyan city of Tripoli. Surpisingly, the locals did not consider us their savior or liberator, rather a colonial invading force and oppressors."
ww1_italy.136.a: "Propaganda time!"
ww1_italy.137.t: "The Ray of Hope"
ww1_italy.137.d: "For a long time, impoverished workers up north have felt forgotten about. Abandoned. At best, they were a tool for the liberal establishment type like Giolitti to exploit for political capital, and at worst brutally repressed by bourgeois aligned governments in Rome. With our new administration, many workers up north who have felt forgotten about are finally getting a hint of optimism. Hopes are high the Bisolatti will finally be able to bring real change to them. Bring them real control over the means of production. Bring them fair and deserved pensions. Stop their bourgeois employers from repressing their right to organize."

While it has allowed for limited domestic industrial growth and a high employment level, its clear the policy has weakened Italy. Thus, as we work towards opening our country towards the world, we will have to be careful not to disrupt our economy too much. If foreign goods flood our country, local businesses and farmers may be forced to shut down, spiking unemployment. High unemployment will cause factory output debuffs, a political power debuff, and higher consumer goods. If foreign industries begin overwhelming domestic industries, domestic industries may begin shutting down, weaking our core industrial base.

ww1_italy.145.t: "Womens Suffrage Ammendment Fails"
ww1_italy.145.d: "Perhaps to be expected, the womens suffrage ammendment pushed by socialists and suprisingly, a handful of hardline conservatives, have failed. With little support amongst the centrists who dominate parliament, the ammendment was shot down with it lacking around 100 votes needed to pass it."
ww1_italy.145.a: "Let's get to serious business, now."
ww1_italy.146.t: "Womens Suffrage Ammendment Passes"
ww1_italy.146.d: "In a quite suprising move, the ammendment to include women into Giolitti's male suffrage bill has passed. This comes as Sonnio agreed to support Giolittis proposed ammendment to have voting require a literacy test in return for Giolittis support for womens suffrage. With only 4 other countries having achieved such a monumental reform, Italy's sure to be on the right side of history."
ww1_italy.146.a: "It was worth it."
ww1_italy.144.d: "The new womens suffrage ammendment has recieved an unexpected endorsement: the full backing of Sidney Sonnino, leader of the conservative opposition. Being in charge of one of the most conservative wings of parliament, his endorsement has suprised many. Justifying his position in a speech to Italy's parliament, he's declared "It is only from universal suffrage that the government can achieve the strength amd legitimacy to represent and protect the general interests of Italy, which is continuously endangered by the particular interests of individuals, localities, and egotistical small interests groups."\n\nStill, the ammendment seems to lean towards failing. Many centrist members are hardly convinced by this argument, being more swayed by Giolittis idea of cautious expansaion of the electorate as Italians education and literacy increases. Gaetano Mosca, another influencial conservative, has also denounced the ammendment and called it a bridge too far."
ww1_italy.145.a: "That debates over, then"
ww1_italy.144.a: "Italy isn't ready for such a radical move yet"
ww1_italy.144.b: "You know what? We'll support it on the condition that literacy is a requirement to vote."
ww1_italy.143.t: "Ammendment on Womens Suffrage"
ww1_italy.143.d: "Some of the more left wing PM's have introduced an ammendment to the male suffrage bill Giolitti has proposed in parliament. The ammendment would change the language of the bill to grant full voting rights to all women of age. It would certainly be a radical move, as only Finland and Norway currently have laws allowing Women to vote. Still, this ammendment is expected to go no where for now."
ww1_italy.143.a: "We'll let it play out"
ww1_italy.141.t: "The 'Game' Isn't Fun Anymore"
ww1_italy.141.d: "Giolitti has often described politics as the 'gentlements game', and his political strategy has reflected that. Giolitti has no problem befriending radical socialists and conservative catholics at the same time, but the web of coalitions, promises, and alliances Giolitti has been employing is starting to frustrate Italian politicians as a whole. People want a genuine fighter, someone who they see as a more principled man. While Giolitti shouldn't exactly be called unprincipled, it's undeniable that Giolitti's web of political connections can frustrate those on both sides. The so-called 'Gentlemens Game' may not have players forever"

ww1_italy.113.d: "Giolitti has defined Italian politics for the last 30 years of our history. His legacy has been very mixed amongst leftist groups, with opinions ranging from his being a force for good who helped push many key reforms to Italian society to him being the greatest oppressor in Italy's history, whos policy of trasformismo helped crush workers across Italy. With our coalition containing people with views of Giolitti on both extreme ends, confronting the legacy of Giolitti has proven hard for Bissolati. How should we define this past era of Italian politics?"

Although the Council of State has no ability to rule on parliamentry action, they can review administartion acts. Through rather generous interpretations of their our power, judges have used this to block all kinds of socialist action. Although never a serious problem before, with socialists in power the judges are now able to seriously hinder our ability to implement our agenda. Thus, we need to somehow deal with the judges. Laws protecting judicial independence mean an outright purge is off the table, but we still have means at our disposal. Judges can be removed if they are charged for corruption or misconduct. In addition, we have legal authority to shuffle judges around if minor positions open up, meaning we could place more anti socialist judges in lower authority positions and replace their high authority position with more friendly judges.

While many glorify the days of the Roman empire, they have few nice things to say about Italy in its current state, maybe justifiably so. Firmly in the third rank of European powers, Italy has earned little respect across the world. Being given a pitiful piece of land in the Horn of Africa after being denied repeatably its actual claims, losing a war to Ethiopia, and having a military hardly better then the decaying Turkish empire are just a few examples of Italys weakness on the world stage, and you'll often here the loudest critics of Italy coming from the nationalists. The call for radical change to make an Italy able to achieve the glory it deserves. Militarism, anti liberalism, and an aggressive foreign policy are all points you'll here nationalists make. Assuming nothing dramatic changes, however, we can expect nationalist circles who claim to love Italy continue to insult it more then any so called 'unpatriotic' liberal would."

The north, while not exactly Paris or London, lives in a relatively confortable amount of wealth. Certainly living more luxurious then someone in Warsaw or Sofia. The south is, however, home to some of the poorest in Europe. Only living moderately better then Russian peasants, Italian farmers down south have been crushed by the North-focused policies of Italian governments, and left plundered by the practically colonial level treatment of southern farmlands for the benefit of north by Italy's governments. While many try to live their lifes, holding bitter resentment, many have decided to flee the country. Most prevalent in the 1880's, millions of Italians have left to other countries - particularly the American east coast. While emmigration has slowed down, it's still very much so still going on in the South. This has led to a variety of issues - certainly our ego has been bruised by this, but the economics of losing millions of people certainly arn't helping Italy right now either."

Local carrot formers in Terni have begun large scale demonstrations demanding we keep the carrot tariffs in place. They claim without them, carrots from foreign countries will flood the local market place at prices they cannot afford. Thus, they would go backrupt and have their very way of life ruined.\n\nSuprisingly, Italian nationalists have used these farmers as a rallying point, using the farmers as examples of every day Italians who will have their life dramatically worsened by the reduction of tariffs. The decision is ours, shall we accept their appeal?"

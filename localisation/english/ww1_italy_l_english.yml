The success of the HMS Dreadnought has made waves around the world, so the merits of the idea are certaintly validated. What remains to be seen is whether the budget can find the space for it. If we were to find the space, though, such a ship would no doubt prove immensly useful in our Mediterrenean activities."

ITA_social_revolution_cat: "The Socialist Revolution"
ITA_social_revolution_cat_desc: "Italy is a beautiful clay, but it has no purpose or shape yet. We must reform the country to transform this clay into a paradise for the proletariat. The three largest areas that workers will look to for reform are the political, economic, and social sections of society. It will not be an easy task to reform all sections of society, but with time and effort, Italy will become a shining example.\n\nAs our reforms take effect, the benefits we receive from the socialist revolution will increase. Currently the state of reforms are as follows:\n\n§lFederal Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_federal_reform_var]%§!\n§LWe've inherited Italy's old and broken political system from before the civil war, a system that cannot stand. Proposals for federal reform range from a total destruction of the government to the construction of a totalitarian all-powerful state.§!\n\n§nLand Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_land_reform_var]%§!\n§LThe vast majority of Italy's land was owned by elitists in the latifondisti. With the victory of the revolution, we must now transfer this land to peasants.§!\n\n§QWorkplace Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_workplace_reform_var]%§!\n§LItaly's proletariat have faced unfathomable oppression by the burgereese. Reforms that empower workers over their employers is a necessity.§!\n\n§CEducation Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_education_reform_var]%§!\n§LThe Kingdom of Italy operated under a heavily decentralized and christianized education system. Debates wage on if schools should be government operated or independent, but all agree schools need to be secularized.§!\n\n§NCultural Reform§! - §Y[?ITA_cultural_reform_var]%§!\n§LThe proletariat lacks a strong class conscious, often times not aware of the power they hold. The culture has also been equally as oppressive to women and minority groups, who lacked rights in the kingdom.§!"

ITA_build_medusa_class_submarines_desc: "Submarine engineer Cesare Laurenti has recently made a new submarine design, the Medusa Class. The new design is a significant step forward from the previous Foca design he made, the first Italian submarine design which is quite outdated now with it's petrol engine. We should get to work building these new submarines, as they are much better and are the next step for our navy."
ITA_build_indominito_class_destroyers: "Construct Indominito Class Destroyers" 
ITA_build_indominito_class_destroyers_desc: "The Indominito Class is a new destroyer design made by engineer Luigi Scaglia. These new ships are much larger and more advanced in many ways, with it's steam turbine instead of a steam engine and will be our first large destroyers when we finish building them."
ITA_build_the_dante_alighieri: "Build the Dante Alighieri"
ITA_build_the_dante_alighieri_desc: "Engineer Edoardo Masdea has made a dreadnought design, the Dante Alighieri class. When finished it will be the first Italian dreadnought, a great achievement for our navy, being a display of our naval power. We should finish up the construction of the ship, and get it with out on the seas with the rest of our Regia Marina."
ITA_build_conte_di_cavour_class: "Build Modern Dreadnoughts"
ITA_build_conte_di_cavour_class_desc: "As European powers are racing to build the most dreadnoughts, we need to catch up if our navy is to stand a chance. A new dreadnought design, the Conte di Cavour class has been made by engineer Edoardo Masdea. The new design has more armour and guns then the Dante Alighieri and is intended to be superior to the dreadnought designs of other European powers."

ITA_build_weather_monitoring_stations: "Build Weather Monitoring Stations"
ITA_build_weather_monitoring_stations_desc: "The weather at sea can completly change the outcome of any naval battle, destroying fleets, so it is critical we take caution. With the new usage of radio technology in our navy, we can build weather monitoring stations to report the weather to our navies and help them avoid disastrous storms."
ITA_train_new_naval_officers: "Train New Naval Officers"
ITA_train_new_naval_officers_desc: "Our navy is expanding a lot, and currently requires many more new naval officers to be properly staffed. With our new experience with modern ships, we should train modern officers who will know how to perfectly operate these recent innovations, such as submarines and dreadnoughts."
ITA_develop_new_hydrophones: "Develop New Hydrophones"
ITA_develop_new_hydrophones_desc: "Submarines are deadly vessels that pose a significant threat to our larger ships as they can be completely hidden and and strike a killing blow. Our current anti-submarine technology currently isn't great at detecting submarines and it's crucial we invest into the development of more precise hydrophone technology to accurately detect where the submarines are."
ITA_organized_naval_barrages: "Organized Naval Barrages"
ITA_organized_naval_barrages_desc: "With the development of our modern fire control systems, we can much more precisely target our large guns at enemy ships and strike devestating blows. We should use this to our advantage, using dreadnought battleships with their many guns in coordinated naval barrages that can devestate enemy fleets."

ITA_free_trade_decat_desc: "Italy has historically used large tariff walls to shield its industries from foreign countries. While it has allowed for limited domestic industrial growth and a high employment level, its clear the policy has weakened Italy. Thus, as we work towards opening our country towards the world, we will have to be careful not to disrupt our economy too much. If foreign goods flood our country, local businesses and farmers may be forced to shut down, spiking unemployment. High unemployment will cause factory output debuffs, a political power debuff, and higher consumer goods. If foreign industries begin overwhelming domestic industries, domestic industries may begin shutting down, weaking our core industrial base. This will lead to lower stability, a political power debuff, and a construction debuff."

ITA_post_war_pm: "The Divided Parliament"
ITA_post_war_pm_desc: "Italy's parliaments have historically been limited to anywhere from two to four parties winning all seats. The shockwaves of the post war effects on the country have lead to several new parties being founded, all with serious shots at winning seats. This means we're likely to have a more multipolar parliament made up of loads of parties controlling a few seats. While electoral alliances are likely to be formed, it still means that governing is going to be much harder then it was before.\n\nThe make up of Italy's parliament will heavily influence who the next prime minister will be in the result of a government collapse. The make up of parliament is currently the following:\n\n[ITA_left_iw_loc]\n\n§7Independent Socialists§!\nThe Independent Socialists currently controls §C[?ITA_iw_ind_psi_seats_election]§!/§Y508§! seats in parliament.\n§LIndependent socialist MP's are various socialists who are not apart of any political party.

ww1_italy.53.t: "Democratic Socialists Remain Control over the PSI"
ww1_italy.53.d: "In a sigh of relief for the Giolitti government, democratic and pro Giolitti socialists have managed to beat out a challenge from the maximalists. Maximalists have already began splitting off from the PSI and declaring the formation of their own party, although it hasn't seen much success. With the PSI remaining reformist, it open the opprotunity to Giolitti to secure a electoral alliance containing them, as he generally prefers them to the catholic block."
ww1_italy.53.a: "Thank god"
ww1_italy.74.t: "Mass Expulsions of pro Giolitti Socialists from the PSI"
ww1_italy.74.d: "A large number of socialists have been kicked out of the PSI for their support of Giolitti, who has seen his favorbility ratings with the public plummet after the disaster in Libya. Their socialists, claim the maximalists who have been leading the clense of the party, are revisionists who betrayed the workers of Italy by supporting their liberal oppressor. These expulsions have seen a dramatic increase in power by the maximalists, who have seen their anti Giolitti rhetoric earn them more support amongst the Italian public."
ww1_italy.75.t: "ANI Party Grow Significantly"
ww1_italy.75.d: "The originally small ANI has seen its members and strength skyrocket as the party has been running a highly successful anti Giolitti campaign, claiming under their leadership the Libyan disaster would never have happened. Their extreme nationalism as well as anti corruption rhetoric has made their message appear very inspiring to the Italian people - a people tired of the constant loses and embarassment on the world stage that the Kingdom of Italy has faced in it's recent history. They're seeing their movement go from a small, niche movement to rapidly becoming one of the largest organized parties in Europe. With this, it's expected they will capture a fair sjare of Italy's parliament seats come the next election - at least at the current rate of their growth."
ww1_italy.75.a: "No need to worry, we can simply use trasformismo on them."
ww1_italy.74.a: "Ha! They're tearing themselves apart"
ww1_italy.71.t: "The Greatest Disaster"
ww1_italy.71.d: "There's no other way to spin it: what happened in Libya was a disaster, probably the greatest disaster in the young kingdoms entire history. What was promised to be a cake walk ended up becoming a humiliating slog that ended in Italy's loss. Thousands have been lost in a war that was managed utterly disastrously by Giolitti.\n\nBoth socialists and nationalists have their own explanation for what went wrong. The socialists are claiming, despite many of them initially  being supportive of the war, that they knew the conflict was always a bad idea - an imperialist adventure over a piece of sand that would have brought no benefit to the common Italian people. The war, they are claiming, was brought on to Giolitti by the interests of big business who intend to use the colony and it's people as a tool to exploit to enrich themselves.\n\nThe nationalists claim the war was completely winnable, if the weak liberal leadership of Giolitti was run by someone stronger, someone who truly loved Italy and wasn't held back by degenerate and liberal values, as well as someone who didn't give into the demanmds of Europes other great powers. Demands that hindered Italy's ability to wage the war.\n\nWith such a resounding defeat after patriotic emotions being so high, many Italians can't help but to be swayed by one of these explanations. Both nationalists and socialists have seen their support begin to skyrocket lately."
ww1_italy.71.a: "Extremely worrying!"
ww1_italy.72.t: "They Told you so!"
ww1_italy.72.d: "The PSI can't help but to remind the Italian people: we warned you the war was not a good idea. For months, much of the PSI waged a anti war campaign, warning the conflict would result in thousands of Italians losing their lives for no benefit to the people. And they were more right then they ever could have predicted. With loses in the thousands, the only thing Italy has to show for it is war reparations to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Many Italians have found themselves swayed by the PSI rhetoric - they were right here, the war was a complete disaster. Maybe they're right about the need for dramatic economic reforms across the country too?"
ww1_italy.72.a: "Oh come on, many of you supported the war!"
ww1_italy.73.t: "The Clearest Case for the Failures of Liberalism"
ww1_italy.73.d: "The Risorgimento was supposed to lead to a new golden age for Italy, one where it would be respected abroad and cement itself as a great player in European politics. What's the actual results? Losing 2 wars to nations in which we had significant advantaged over. Twice, liberals have completely blown it when it mattered most. Because of liberals lack of love for Italy, it's refusal to escalate wars in fear of the great powers of Europe, and the corruption of liberal governments, Italy has been completely humiliated on the world stage twice in a row. Only through strong leadership, anti corruption, and nationalism can Italy hope to fufill the ideas of Risorgimento."
ww1_italy.73.a: "Liberty should be cherished by all Italians!"
ww1_italy.54.t: "International Pressure"
ww1_italy.54.d: "Our navy has clashed with the Ottoman navy in the Central Mediterranean Sea near the port of Preveza, in Greece. It seems this has caused quite the international reaction, as we're recieving demands from Austria, Russia, and Greece to limit our naval activities in the Balkans and to ensure the war does not spread into a regional conflict. This has outraged the nationalists, who are calling on Italy to reject the international pressure and do whatever operations in the war it pleases."
ww1_italy.54.a: "Whatever"
ww1_italy.55.t: "Austro-Italian Incident at sea"
ww1_italy.55.d: "While patrolling the seas, our ships open fired and sunk an enemy vessel. At least, that's what we thought happened. It turns out we accidently sunk an Austrian vessel instead. The Austrians are completely outraged, and we can expect a response from them soon."
ww1_italy.55.a: "Jesus Christ! This is completely their fault"
ww1_italy.56.t: "[AUS.GetName] Demand an Apology"
ww1_italy.56.d: "The Austrians have sent a formal demand to our government that we apologize to them for the accidental sinking of one of their ships. In addition, they are demanding that we 'avoid further escalation' of the war with the Ottomans, that we are under no circumstances to annex land from or expand the war to the Balkans, and that we are to limit our naval action in general."
ww1_italy.56.a: "Those Bastards! We have no choice..."
ww1_italy.47.t: "Sifting Through the Files"
ww1_italy.47.d: "Giolitti sat at this desk, pondering to to convince parliament to pass his upcoming male suffrage bill. He'd plan to propose it soon, but there was a real force of opposition on the right. He knew what to do, though. Giolitti got out his files that he had on every member of parliament. For every single member of parliament, Giolitti kept a small file about them: their weaknesses. Giolitti has always been a master at manipulation, and he often credited it to these files. He looked through the opposition, one by one he started formulating a plan to manipulate key PM's into falling into line. He wasn't worried anymore. He'd get it done."
ww1_italy.47.a: "He's had 3 cabinets already for a reason, after all."
ww1_italy.46.t: "Mantaining a Friendly Socialist Party"
ww1_italy.46.d: "The PSI has elected to, for the last 3 Giolitti cabinets, to not stand in strong opposition to him. It seems they have voted to do the same this time around. The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There is leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists takeover the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their withdraw from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."
ww1_italy.46.a: "Let's hope they stick to their senses, then."
ww1_italy.40.t: "Not 'Liberators' After all..."
ww1_italy.40.d: "Our troops and even Giolitti himself were under the, in hindsight rather naive, assumption that Italian troops would be welcomed with parades and gifts of home cooked meals by the locals of Libya, who desperately awaited for Italian troops to liberate them. This has turned out to be completely wrong however, as Libyan locals are just as resistant to Italian liberation as they are to Ottoman oppression. We've seen little to no local cooperation against the Ottoman Empire in Libya. If anything, the locals seem to prefer the turks to us."
ww1_italy.40.a: "We're doing whats best for them, even if they don't understand it!"
ww1_italy.35.t: "Business Owners Request Meditation in Strikes"
ww1_italy.35.d: "There's been a dramatic increase in strike up north which is slowing down our industry. It comes as the socialist party drifts further and further towards revolutionary rhetoric as it intends to bring change through force instead of through the democratic system. These increases in strikes are leading to northern business owners to call on us to intervene, and favor employers in strike negotiations."
ww1_italy.35.a: "Restricting their right to strike will only anger them further"
ww1_italy.35.b: "We can certainly play a role in these strike negotiations"
ww1_italy.36.t: "'No Justice, No Peace' vs 'a Revolution From the Ballot Box'"
ww1_italy.36.d: "There's been a debate amongst socialist circles lately on just how reformable Italian democracy is. There's an increasing sentiment of refusing to make peace with a system seen as unfixable. With Italies current electoral system for example, only a fraction of Italians - generally more well off then the average Italian - are the ones who vote. How are socialists supposed to win in this rigged system?\n\nOn the other side, however, the more moderate reformists in the PSI still believe democracy is far from irredeemable. It has its issues, yes, but the sort of violent and anti democratic rhetoric from the maximalists is far from the solution. They instead coin the idea of a 'revolution from the ballot box' in which Italians will eventually wake up from the oppressions of capitalism and give them at least a major say in the make up of Italy's parliament, in which they will pass suffrage reform and thus secure an electoral mandate for years to come."
ww1_italy.36.a: "How can you claim to represent the people without accepting democracy"
ww1_italy.36.b: "The current laws of Italy make socialists legally being elected impossible!"
ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. While this rhetoric is on the fringe right now, it's gaining traction. Some nationalists are indeed calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of Arab nationalism and Balkan rage. For now, though, the idea is seen as a bit ridiculous by most credible Italian politicians."
ww1_italy.20.a: "That certainly sounds nice!"
ww1_italy.22.t: "A Divided Party"
ww1_italy.23.t: "Failed Anti-War Strike"
ww1_italy.23.d: "Several anti-war socialists have attempted to organize national opposition towards a war with Turkey. Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary. Such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Even then, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. What good is a strike if that promised war would never come in the first place?"
ww1_italy.23.a: "Only time will tell."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to respect our national sovereignty with their claims on ethnic Italian land and whatnot. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be sought from this is that Italy needs to grow strong, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."
ww1_italy.19.a: "Not a bad idea."
ww1_italy.18.t: "La Guerra Lontana"
ww1_italy.21.t: "The Socialist Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.21.d: "The increasing public demand for a war to conquer Libya has come as a great suprise to the left. In their eyes, the issue was over with. Settled years ago in the Congress of Berlin. With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, have began denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression. A war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of minority being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialsist to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to tear a rift amongst socialists in Italy."
ww1_italy.22.a: "The socialist party is anti war at heart, no?"
ww1_italy.22.b: "Nationalistic socialists huh? Interesting"
ww1_italy.21.a: "Don't let them distract you from your real issues!"
ww1_italy.18.d: "The influencial Italian writer Corradini has recently published a new book promoting Italian nationalism and expansionism. In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with the sick man of europe: The Ottoman Empire. With the Ottomans being so weak, surely Libya would be easy pickings, right?"
ww1_italy.18.a: "La Guerra Vittoriosa!"
ww1_italy.17.t: "Formation of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana"
ww1_italy.17.d: "Today, hundreds of journalists, literary figures, and educators gathered in florence to create a new political movement, the ANI. This group has characterized itself as an ultra nationalist and expanionist group who intends to promote the expansion of Italy into various different territories. In particular, the group seems interested in Libya. They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia. The group has began publications across Italy to rally people to the cause of Italiah expansionism, and it's having its effect. More and more people are beginning to support colonial wars, with Libya being an especially popular target."
ww1_italy.17.a: "They really do have a few points..."
ww1_italy.15.t: "Mantaining Government Stability"
ww1_italy.15.d: "Luzzatti's government fell apart because he did not a base political support from any faction in Italy's parliament, but Giolitti is no novice to Italian politics. Already serving 3 terms as prime minister, he knows how to carefully and strategically align and isolate political factions whenever needed. With his 4th mandate secured, he'll need to keep enough support from MP's in Italy's parliament to ensure his governments survival."
ww1_italy.15.a: "It's what Giolitti does best!"
ww1_italy.14.t: "The Return of Giolitti"
ww1_italy.14.d: "Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. With Luzzatti's weak leadership failing to consolidate a base of support, and an impending vote of no confidence, Luzzatti has resigned to avoid an embarassing ousting. Who will run the next government? Giolitii, of course. It was always going to be Giolitii. No other Italian politician has nearly as much influence and support as him. With him easily securing the Prime Minister slot, time will tell how his 4th cabinet ends up."

ww1_italy.13.d: "It is no secret that our status as a great power lies with the north, not the south. The duchies and republics that made Northern Italy their home were able to consolidate and advance to greater heights because of the relative peace. The predecessor to our nation, Sardinia-Piedmont, is such an example.\n\nThe south has, in contrast, laid in a state of disrepair for over a thousand years, exploited by the Arabs, the French, and the Spaniards. It is a shame to say our current policies do much of the same.\n\nAll these pieces of history have shaped the way Italy is today: from the top down. The problem is, the wealth never trickles down, it only flows to the north. It is a price we must bear as a nation, yet only one part does so. Our industrial might shall remain concentrated in Turin, Milan, and the Venetian countryside for as long as this remains. It does not look like it will change anytime soon, but that is just another sad story in the annals of the history of our peninsula."

If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however.

The centrists want Giolitti back, the catholics want a new conservative prime minister, the socialists were never never going to support us, neither were the far right. With pretty much every faction of the government wanting us gone, it's basically inevitable the government will be pushed out by a vote of no confidence soon, unless we resign before then."

ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Luzzatti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."

ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. A lot of the power base of the PSI comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to their demands. Still though, it's hard to argue our recent overtures to the PSI have been useless. We have indeed secured a small base of support from their party to our upcoming agenda."

ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysis are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country, catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists see him as weak, at best, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a no confidence vote, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a no confidence vote, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."

The press, however, has began pushing for a war with the Ottomans to secure Libyan, with an earnest response from their readers. They claim Libya is full of natural resources and a population pleading for Italian liberation, being defended by a measly 4 thousand soldiers. Word of mouth proves quite capable too, with whispers being exchanged in parliament about how capturing Libya would be a walk in the park.

The both also understand working with eachother can have mutual benefits for themselves and the country. However, Giolitti's recent policies of municipal socialism has lead to great anger amongst them. These policies are cutting deeply into their profits and causing business growth to slow down.

This is the question many nationalists writers across the country are asking, in light of the recent news of the compromise with the Ottoman Empire over the Libyan question. While a protectorate won't hurt Italy, Italy could have gotten so much more. A full annexation of Libya, war reperations, hell Albania were all on the table. This sort of weakness from the Italian Government, they argue, is unacceptable. "

It seems a liberal-catholic alliance is not crazy at all, at least not as crazy as you would think it to be 10 years ago, as alliances between catholics and liberals have been popping up in at the local level in Turin, Florence, and Venice. They ally together in part because of fear from socialists and ultra nationalists. With this, Giolitti has been looking at somehow expanding these local alliances at the national level."

Despite decrying the peace deal secured by Giolitti as medicore, the treaty has remained highly popular amongst the Italian people. Thus, the nationalists have shifted towards claiming credit for starting the war in the first place. They claim Giolitti only started the war out of a pressure campaign from the nationalists. Their claims do, of course, have a level of truth to them. This has led towards their support increasingly amongst the Italian people dramatically."

ww1_italy.45.d: "Turati (the leader of the PSI) has been in complete favor with working together with Giolitti on legislation advancing the rights of workers and peasants alike. However, it seems Turati has calculated that cooperation with Giolitti is becoming less and less politically viable. With extremist maximalists becoming a greater force in the Italian political sphere, calculating working with Giolitti only serves to anger them, and fracture the party, Turati has been less and less open to working with Giolitti. Thus, Giolitti's overtures to Turati have been increasingly rebutted, as Turati seeks to mantain the unity of his party."

Indeed, Giolitti did take the opposite stance on the issue then the one he has been parading as of late, however Giolitti has presented his own argument to them on why Italy is ready for the expansion of the electorate. He's argued that Italy is much more educated and has much higher literacy rates then it did just 20 years ago, with education helping to build a 'regime of liberty'. Giolitti has, depending on who you ask either boldly or delusionally, claimed that Italy's working class will not be swayed by 'lunatucs'. He argued that the general masses are smarter then given credit for, and that as labor conditions improve through labor action, socialism will gradually decline in Italy. He certainly isn't swaying any conservatives with his arguments, but some of the old guard liberals are starting to come around."

Working with them has, historically, been much easier. In addition, a liberal democracies health cannot be strong without participation from all parts of society. Thus, while catholics are a political enemy for now, it's crucial they still participate in politics. Besides, who knows? Maybe we'll find them to be our newest friends."

This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with.

ww1_italy.42.d: "Our recent successes in the Libyan campaign have led to an even greater nationalist fever in Italy then before. People are celebrating our success, the inevitable collapse of the Ottoman military, and are awaiting for us to push them completely out of Libya. In fact, our recent successes have made nationalsists so sure that we are curb stomping the Ottoman Empire, they are calling for us to expand the war. They specifically call for us to make naval landings in Albania and kick the Ottoman garrison out, which could cause mass revolts across the Turkish balkans and lead to a collapse of their empire in that region. It would deal a unrecoverable blow to Turkey and also secure us Albania.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this notion is completely infeasable. Our limited naval actions around Albania themself have caused mass protests from Greece, Russia, and Austria, who have threatened us into drawing back. Any demands of Albanian annexation would cause complete international outrage and isolation, thus we must stick to Libya"
ww1_italy.42.a: "The nationalists are gonna have a hard time stomaching this."
ww1_italy.43.t: "Unless..."
ww1_italy.43.d: "Albania may be off limits, but there's still places we can expand the war. We've been eyeing up the Dodecanese for a while now, and there's been little to no protest from any country but the Greeks at our naval presense near the islands. Thus, we should be able to easily take them for ourself. It's not the prize that Albania is, but it should still help to satisfy the nationalists, and besides the island are indeed useful naval bases."

ww1_italy.44.d: "These are the words being used to describe the Treaty of Ouchy with the Ottoman Empire. There's no other way to spin it, they claim.

Moderates have been kicked out of the party, with a new moderate socialist party already being formed. Most importantly, and also worryingly, they've denounced cooperation with Giolitti and are encouraging members of the PSI to refuse to work with him. Giolitti's coalition has enjoyed a decent amount of socialist support in the past, and with support from the PSI being pretty much a done deal, Giolitii will have to look towards other coalition partners."

They claim he wants to insult the lower classes by ensuring would not enjoy the prestige and self-fulfillment of electing a government which granted them the right to vote.

While Giolittis standing amongst socialists is shaky, he had enjoyed some support from the more moderate members of the party.

ww1_italy.80.d: "Due to the rapidly deteriorating situation of the country, parliament and the king have agreed to grant Giolitti temporary emergency powers to deal with the situation. Giolitti has already prepared to intervene in strikes across the country and force employees to capitulate to worker demands, hoping to bring a swift end to the on going general strike and begin to stabilize the country. Giolitti's key issue however is that the left has rapidly radicalized in the last few months, and although he may be able to put an end to the strike, there's no getting rid of their anger. Still, the emergency powers are the first step towards restoring order across the country for Giolitti."
ww1_italy.80.a: "Stand back and stand by!"
ww1_italy.84.t: "Giolitti Announces Timeline for Emergency Powers"
ww1_italy.84.d: "With the country in a... slightly better place then it was a month ago, Giolitti has announced he intends to relinquish his emergency powers after the 1913 parliamentry elections. He claims the current emergency powers are needed to mantain the peace across the country and ensure political violence is kept to a minimum and that labor-employee relations can be kept from boiling into another general strike."
ww1_italy.84.a: "He's no tyrant!"
ww1_italy.94.t: "Giolitti Resigns in Disgrace"
ww1_italy.94.d: "The loss in Libya has completely collapsed support for Giolitti's government. With very little public support and all confidence in him lost, Giolitti has handed in his resignation to the king. In his place, Giolitti has reccomended Antonio Salandra as his replacement, and thus the king has tasked him with forming a new government."

ww1_italy.82.t: "Riots Across Southern Italy"
ww1_italy.83.t: "Death of the Center"
ww1_italy.83.d: "The recent few months of chaos across the country have caused Italians to rapidly polarize, with a plurality of Italians now supporting either socialism or nationalism. People are fed up of a country that's failed 2 wars it should have won, that's seen millions have to flee to other countries because Italy's economy wasn't enough for them, thats recently been engulfed in riots, thats been ruled by corrupt centrists for the last 30 years. People want change, they don't believe centrist liberals can bring it anymore. One things for sure, Italy's next elections are going to see a dramatically different parliament."
ww1_italy.83.a: "Nonsense, the Italian people are too politically mature for this!"
ww1_italy.82.d: "While the general strike up north has been put to an end, the situation in the country can hardly become stable. With Giolitti already unpopular down south, his new emergency powers have worried southerners he intends to become a dictator, and continue enforcing pro north policies on their backs. It's led to mass anti Giolitti protests taking place, with some led by the ANI turning into riots. Although currently the death count it zero, nearly a hundred people have been arrested and several incidents have led to injuries."
ww1_italy.82.a: "God Damnit, why can't they just go away!"
ww1_italy.81.t: "Giolittis Intervention Brings Strike to an end"
ww1_italy.81.d: "Giolitti has used his expanded powers to force his will upon employers across italy, forcing them to accept a variety of workers demands. It's outraged northern business, but has successfully brought most people back to work. Interestingly enough, Giolitti has refused to yield his emergency powers yet, calling it 'too early'. This has led to the PSI hurling a whole new range of attacks on Giolitti, calling him an offical dictator with some maximalists even calling for him to be violently overthrown."
ww1_italy.81.a: "Can we get back to normal soon?"
ww1_italy.79.d: "Armed workers have been caught up in standoffs with police across the country, as the murder of workers up north and the general increase of violence has led to mass panic amongst the workers that they may find themselves the victim of a brutal and sudden crackdown if they do not arm themselves. This has led to viral photos of armed workers staring down police in more then 1 part of the country, although no actual incidents have been reported so far. Parliament, and the King, have been called to convene with Giolitti to discuss a response as the situation looks dire."

ww1_italy.77.a: "A tragedy we must not repeat"
ww1_italy.78.t: "Outbreak of Political Violence Across Italy"
ww1_italy.78.d: "The recent incident up north has led to a dramatic rise in political violence across the country, as socialists intensify their rioting and the ANI continues organizing their own marches. Across the country, several Italians have been severly injured as clashes with police and eachother leads to regrettable aftermaths. The situation has become worrying to Giolitti, who isn't sure what to do about the state of the country. Sending in the army or the police could cause a civil war, but with the current direction of the country doing nothing might too."
ww1_italy.78.a: "We must make it through this!"
ww1_italy.76.d: "Seeing Giolitti's widespread unpopularity, the socialists have cast the die. Socialists have organized several labor unions into a general strike. They're demanding a wide variety of benefits - increased pay, less hours, stricter labor standards, and more. This has put Giolitti's government between a rock and a hard place. The general strike is sure to nuke his popularity even further, as prices rise. He can't, however, give into their demands. Parliamemt is simply too moderate to get such an expansive bill through parliament. While Giolitti has been trying to play meditator, even siding with the workers in several instances, he's failed to stop the strike from happening."
ww1_italy.76.a: "Shit!"
ww1_italy.77.t: "Workers Killed in Clash with Police"
ww1_italy.77.d: "The police had been called to deal with a riot up north, and the aftermath has made headline news across the country. Rioting workers refused to cooperate with workers, and although its unknown which side fired first, after trying to arrest a group of armed workers, firing began on both sides. The police won the shoot out, killing at least 5 people. The PSI has been quick to denounce the shooting by the police as an unnecessary slaughter of workers exercising their right to strike and protest. This incident has led to a wave of fear and outrage across Italy, as workers fear the police could come after them next. Several workers are looking towards arming themselves, and the situation has some worried Italy is on the verge of a revolution."

ww1_italy.58.t: "Formation of the Liberal Union"
ww1_italy.58.d: "Perhaps the most egregious example of trasformiso has hit Italy as Giolitti's most traditional oppostion group: Catholics, have paraded a electoral alliance with Giolitti formed just a few days ago. The crucial Catholic vote will help significantly with ensuring that liberals and Catholics don't end up splitting their vote up north which would lead to a socialist sweep. The alliance will also help ensure that the south is delivered to Giolitti's electoral block. Although the alliance does have one dramatic drawback: Giolitti's coalition had often in the past contained northern organized labor. With the formation of this allaince, it's likely that block will go to the PSI this time around. Still, this won't matter if the Liberal Union is able to truly unite Catholics behind Giolitti."
ww1_italy.58.a: "This is unifying!"
ww1_italy.59.t: "The Seven Commandments of the Liberal Union"
ww1_italy.59.d: "Of course, the alliance with the Catholics has required concessions from Giolitti. After intense negotiations, the following concessions have been made:\n1: Defend liberty of conscience and association as established in the constitution and therefore oppose any bill inspired by hatred of the religious congregations, or which intends to the religious tranquality of the nation\n2: Support the principle that with the increase and development of the public school system, there will not be any attempts to discredit the work of privare institutions whose work was to be considered an important factor in the elevation and diffusion of national culture\n3: Remove any uncertainty about the legal right of parents to have their children provided with religious instruction in the public schools\n4: Resist any attempt to weaken the family unit and hence absolutely oppose divorce\n5: Recognize the equality of economic and social organizations before the law, irrespective of the social or religious principles which inspired such organizations\n6: Advocate gradual but continuous reforms in fiscal matters in the sense of an increased application of the principle of social justice\n7: Uphold a policy which is intended to conserve and reinvigorate the economic and moral forces of the country, increasing Italian influence in the development of international civilization."
ww1_italy.59.a: "It's all reasonable!"
ww1_italy.62.t: "1913 Elections"
ww1_italy.65.t: "Moves in the Shadows"
ww1_italy.65.d: "Giolitti has been meeting with several key PM's, and been a lot more engaged in parliament activities then usualy lately. This has led to most people in the government predicting Giolitti intends to return to power sometime soon. The unfortunate reality of our situation is that almost every political faction in Italy favors Giolitti over Luzzatti, thus if Giolitti truly wants the Prime Minister spot back we're almost powerless to stop him."
ww1_italy.65.a: "I thought he had our back!"
ww1_italy.63.t: "A Parliament not Like the Others"
ww1_italy.63.d: "The new Italian parliament has a dramatic distinction between it and previous ones: the members are much more radical. It's been compared to the difference between the national assembly and the national convention during the French Revolution: the members of the new Italian parliament are generall younger, less cautious, and more polarized. It's leading to many PM's across different parties to reject Giolitti's trasformismo, as many feel alienated by the constant backroom deals and contradictionary deals of the last 2 years under Giolitti. In addition, there's a lot more socialist and nationalists then in the last parliament, and despite attempting to work with both groups, they've proven to be a bit... stubborn. With them now making up around 1/5th of parliament, it certainly makes things harder."
ww1_italy.63.a: "Let's hope the aging man still has it"
ww1_italy.66.t: "Radicals Announce Withdrawal from Government Coalition"
ww1_italy.66.d: "It's no secret that the Radical party had extreme discontent for Giolitti due to his alliance with the Catholic Electoral Union, although Radical party leaders had held off from doing anything drastic - until now. Ettore Sacchi today announced his party would be leaving Giolitti's political alliance and would no longer be supporting his government. This is a devestating blow to Giolitti's government, who had relied on high levels of support from the radical party. While Giolitti does now have strong support from catholics, it's not clear if his government will be able to survive this defeat."
ww1_italy.66.a: "Whatever! We don't need them anyways!"
ww1_italy.70.t: "A Blow we may not be Able to Recover From"
ww1_italy.70.d: "The radical withdraw from our government has caused complete chaos for Giolitti's government alliance. Nationalists and socialists smell blood, conservatives are reconsidering their alliance with Giolitti, and even some liberals think he's betrayed their values with his pact with the catholic electoral union. This has led to his support across Italy's parliament to begin to collapse, and Giolitti's beginning to see the writing on the wall. Giolitti has had 3 cabinets already, and he's quite confident he can make another political comeback at a later date, thus he is considering a resignation. This would allow him to save face by avoiding a vote of no confidence brought on by extremist parties, but some allies of Giolitti, and the king himself, wish for him to stay for the time being. What's the move?"
ww1_italy.70.a: "We need to resign, there's no way foward with this parliament"
ww1_italy.70.b: "There's still a pathway foward!"
ww1_italy.64.t: "Growing Discontent with Trasformismo"
ww1_italy.64.d: "The Italian public and political establishment are getting to be fed up with the policy of trasformismo in general. One day Giolitti is making key pledges to industrialist business men and the next day he is promoting municipal socialism in the north. Both sides are increasingly disillusioned with a man who they see as completely unrealiable. The Italian public is also angry as they feel Giolitti is corrupt and not trustable. One thing is for sure: people arn't finding the game fun anymore."
ww1_italy.64.a: "What are they mad about? Politics is simply a game of deals!"
ww1_italy.62.d: "The 1913 parliament election results are in, and it seems while the Liberal union held its own, it still lost seats over all. This comes as both far left and far right canidates have seen great success this election cycle, with the PSI and nationalists both expanding their seats in parliament. If this election was a referendum on Giolitti, it certainly proved the Italian people are somewhat tired of him. "
ww1_italy.62.a: "Well, it could have gone worse!"
ww1_italy.86.d: "Despite attempts by Giolitti and catholics to push for Antonio Salandra, socialists - combined with a few radical pm's, have successfully formed a new government with plurality support. Although the king was very hesitant to allow the socialists to form a government, seeing the increased radicalization of both nationalists and socialists, denying their legitimate government would most likely cause a civil war. Thus, bregrungingly, the king has allowed the socialists to form a government. "
ww1_italy.86.a: "We'll give them a fair shot"
ww1_italy.86.t: "Ascension of the Socialists"
ww1_italy.85.t: "1913 Elections - Extremist Takeover"
ww1_italy.85.d: "It seems the 1913 elections were as poor for Giolitti as predicted - his coalition has lost over 200 seats in parliament, with most the gains going to nationalists and socialists. Italy's parliament is now deeply radical, deeply polarized, and has a deep hatred for Giolitti. With such a horrible election showing, and him now giving up his granted emergency powers, it seems Giolitti will be ousted by a vote of no confidence, or will have to resign himself, within a few weeks."
ww1_italy.85.a: "We'll be back!"
ww1_italy.60.t: "Formation of the Leftist Union"
ww1_italy.60.d: "Despite being very hesitant to work with socialists, the triumph of moderate socialists over the radical maximalists has led GIolitti to believe a deal with them could be made. Thus, he reached out to Turati to form a electoral alliance between the socialists, radicals, and Giolitti's liberals. The formation of this all leftist union has outraged catholics and conservatives, who feel Giolitti may be irredeemable now. However, the electoral alliance does make Giolitti's prospects in the next election very strong. The help of organized labor up north will mean Giolitti will have a death grip over the region, basically securing a parliament majority. "
ww1_italy.60.a: "Pleasure to do business!"
ww1_italy.51.t: "Maximalists Increase Control over the PSI"
ww1_italy.51.d: "Despite showing lukewarm support for the war at first, the maximalists have quickly flip-flopped on the issue decrying the war as a massive failure of Giolitti and another reason why the PSI should refuse to work with him. Indeed, the Turkish Italian war has proven to be very unpopular amongst socialists due to it being bloodier and longer then promised. Their rallying cries have increased support for their vision in the party of no liberal cooperation, and caused some PSI MP's to flip to opposing our government."
ww1_italy.51.a: "Bastards!"
ww1_italy.95.t: "Catholic Opposition"
ww1_italy.95.d: "Catholics have been organized against socialists for years at this point, and the asscension of them into government has not been met with open arms by them. Catholics across the country are organizing resistance to the government and mobilizing people to protest anti church laws as well as organize for the next election. "
ww1_italy.95.a: "They have nothing to fear!"
ww1_italy.97.t: "Coalition Members Suggest Abolishing the Monarchy"
ww1_italy.97.d: "Members of the all-left coalition have been increasingly floating Republican ideas lately, with the majority of the coalition openly supporting the creation of a Republic. The problem is that the king is paying attention, and he's certainly not happy about it. The king has personally requested Bissolati help... get the coalition under control. Asking the coalition to tone done the rhetoric would, however, most likely cause immense anger. "
ww1_italy.97.a: "They need to tone it down"
ww1_italy.97.b: "They're free to express their opinion"

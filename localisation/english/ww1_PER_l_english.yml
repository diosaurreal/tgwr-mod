 PER_idea_rural_society_fake_desc:0 "Persia, dwarfed in comparison to the economies of the European and American nations, and cursed with political instability, is in a difficult position to modernise. The rapid decline has distracted the Persian nation from adapting its agrarian economy, and with it comes the cost of heavy economic reliance and a lack of infrastructure to industrialise from. And while the Persian army does not suffer from this as much as it logically should due to the military missions sent by the European powers, Persia is left completely vulnerable to invasion due to its lack of an industrial base, even from tribes inside of its borders. The revolutionary instability has already done grave harm to the integrity and glue of the nation, and this lack of centralisation is the cherry on top of Persia's problems."
 PER_idea_foreign_reliance_fake:0 "Foreign Reliance"
 PER_idea_foreign_reliance_fake_desc:0 "Throughout the long century, the Russian Empire and the British Empire, currently in the middle of the Great Game, looked to Persia as a chess piece. From its geographic location, Persia was seen by both nations as a buffer zone against the other. Persia, if controlled by the British, would expose Russia's underbelly, that is the Caucasus and Central Asia. Were it to be under Russian control, it would cut through the British Empire, exposing Kuwait and Baluchistan. The Persian diplomats, eager to exploit this prospect, wanted to use this cold war to secure Persian independence by playing both sides against each other. This foreign policy strategy, however, failed tremendously, following the softening of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire."

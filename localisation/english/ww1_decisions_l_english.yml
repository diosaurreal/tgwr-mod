 AUH_greater_austria_category_desc: "Our Empire is a country of many peoples such as Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Croats, Slovens, Poles, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Romanians, and Italians. At one time we grouped them under one name, Austrian Empire, and now we grouped them under two names, Austria-Hungary. However, in order for our country to prosper in the ever-changing era and the frenzy of nationalism, we must recognize multi-ethnicity and make it our identity."

 AUH_assimilate_galicia_desc: "The Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria, part of Cisleithania, ruled by the Austrian Empire, and the Duchy of Bukovina are located on the north-eastern border of the Empire and are predominantly Poles and Ukrainians. The Poles in the west are friendly and relatively wealthy, while the Ukrainians in the east are mostly poor peasants and dissatisfied with our rule. Separating the regions where they each have a majority and allowing autonomy would reduce conflict and lead to integration into the multi-ethnic empire."
 AUH_assimilate_hungary: "Transleithanian Autonomy"
 AUH_assimilate_hungary_desc: "The Kingdom of Hungary is a core region of the Austrian Empire, occupying most of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. The Kingdom of Hungary is a personal union of the Habsburgs, and the Hungarians originally revolted against the Empire in the Revolution of 1848, but are doing well after the Ausgleich, which elevated them to partners of imperial rule and granted them autonomy. However, the eastern part of the Kingdom of Hungary is inhabited by a large number of Romanians, while the southern part is inhabited by Croats, who want more autonomy or rather independence."

 AUH_assimilate_illyria_desc: "The Kingdom of Illyria is a country formed by combining the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which was under Hungarian rule, and the relatively recently acquired Condominion of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The South Slavs are generally dissatisfied with the rule of the empire, but the Croatians are somewhat friendly, and the Bosnians are willing to unite with [SER.GetName] at any moment. If we show them how our empire has changed, they will conform to the rule of the empire and enjoy their autonomy with satisfaction."
 AUH_assimilate_serbia: "Illyrian Autonomy"
 AUH_assimilate_serbia_desc: "The Kingdom of Illyria is formed by comining the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which was under Hungarian rule, and the relatively recently obtained Condominium of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the recent surprising events brought the Kingdom of Serbia to the Illyria, giving them great influence within the empire.\nIt will take a lot of autonomy and goodwill to rule this volatile and vast kingdom well."

But now, if Italians were also regarded as equals in our empire, they would prefer to enjoy stability in our prosperous empire than to be united."

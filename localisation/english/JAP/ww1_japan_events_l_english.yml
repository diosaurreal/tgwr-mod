 ww1_japan.100.d: "The Korean Empire, effectively a protectorate of [JAP.GetNameDef] following Japanese victories in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, has ceased to exist as a separate entity. The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, signed between the Korean government and [JAP.GetAdjective] representatives, has resulted in the peninsula's full annexation into the Empire of Japan. While both [RUS.GetNameDef] and the [USA.GetNameDef] have voiced objections, no official actions have been taken against [JAP.GetNameDef]. It appears that Korea, a nation with a long and distinct history, has been absorbed with little more than diplomatic protests."

Although the official announcement stated he died today, the actual death occurred late last night. Following the emperor's death, the Imperial Diet passed a resolution to commemorate his role in the Meiji Restoration. An iris garden in Tokyo, known to be visited by Emperor Meiji and the Empress, has been chosen as the location for the Shinto shrine Meiji Jingu.

Plagued by health problems throughout his life, his reign saw periods of political openness but also growing social and political tensions. His son, Crown Prince Hirohito, who has served as Regent for several years due to the Emperor's declining health, now ascends the throne. Unlike his father, whose mausoleum is near Kyoto, Emperor Taishō will be interred in the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in Tokyo."
 ww1_japan.1.t: "Japan Demands to Annexation"
 ww1_japan.1.d: "Terauchi Masatake, the Resident-General dispatched by the Empire of Japan, has arrived in Korea bearing a plan for the country's annexation into Japan. The Resident-General \"courteously\" informed Korea's senior ministers of Japan's intentions, requesting their cooperation. Yi Wanyong, the Prime Minister of the Korean Empire, readily welcomed and assented to the plan. The Emperor, well aware that Japan had already stripped away many of his rights, and that his own enthronement followed Japan's forced abdication of his father, the preceding Emperor, remained powerless. He officially expressed neither consent nor refusal. However, he refused to affix the Korean Empire's National Seal, which was required for diplomatic documents, to the annexation agreement. As he was not in a position to offer outright resistance, this appears to have been his way of preventing the legal conditions necessary for the annexation to take effect."
 ww1_japan.1.a: "He thus refused to set a seal..."
 ww1_japan.2.t: "Korean Emperor Refused To Sign The Annexation"
 ww1_japan.2.d: "Our dispatched Resident-General to Korea, Terauchi Masatake, demanded that the Korean Emperor and his court affix the National Seal to the annexation petition. However, the Emperor neither affirmed nor denied, and thus did not stamp the document. There is an easier path for us. Since we forced his father's abdication, we have held possession of the Emperor's personal seal, which is used for domestic administrative documents within Korea. While the Korean Empire's Imperial Seal is required for diplomatic documents, we can instead use this personal seal through the hands of the Korean Prime Minister, who is loyal to us. In any case, foreign powers such as the United States have already implicitly agreed to our annexation of Korea, so no one will raise an issue over such "minor" procedural matters."
 ww1_japan.2.a: "Proceed."
 ww1_japan.3.t: "The Last Hours In Korea"
 ww1_japan.3.d: "Ultimately, instead of affixing the National Seal to the document, Japan decided to use the Emperor's personal seal for administrative documents, which they had already obtained. The seal affixed to the document was labeled the \"Seal of Imperial Edict\", a stamp originally not intended for diplomatic use. The Emperor's powerless resistance proved futile. The last imperial conference was convened at Heungbokheon Hall of Changdeokgung Palace, and without the Emperor's explicit consent, Yi Wanyong, the Prime Minister of the Korean Empire, and Prince Heung, Yi Jaemyeon (the Emperor Gwangmu's elder brother), signed the annexation treaty, claiming full plenipotentiary powers from the Imperial Court. This, too, was an unprecedented act in our nation, violating all established regulations and procedures.\nFollowing the annexation, the use of the name \"Korea\" was prohibited, and the country was reverted to its pre-reform name, Joseon (known as Chōsen in Japanese pronunciation). The Emperor was demoted to Yi King, and our nation's institutional system was likewise downgraded from the protocols of an empire to those of a kingdom. In return, Japan agreed to provide a certain amount of financial support and continue proper courtesies to maintain the royal family's dignity. The traitors who assented to the annexation received peerage titles and celebratory grants from the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe Emperor left his final words as Emperor:\n\"We, lacking in virtue, inherited this difficult and great task, and since Our ascension to this day, We have repeatedly planned, prepared, and striven with all Our might to reform the government. However, the inherent weakness accumulated over time has become an inveterate disease, and the exhaustion has reached its extreme, leaving no hope of implementing policies to recover in a short time. In Our worry in the dead of night, there is no discernible plan for a good outcome. If We continue to manage this, the disarray will only worsen, eventually reaching a point beyond self-recovery. It is better to entrust this great responsibility to another, thereby securing a method for completion and achieving the efficacy of reform. Therefore, We resolutely reflect upon Our internal state and firmly make this decision to cede the sovereignty of Korea to His Majesty the Emperor of Great Japan, Our long-trusted and relied-upon neighboring country, so as to consolidate peace in the East externally, and preserve the livelihood of the people of the Eight Provinces internally. All of you, Our great and small subjects, must deeply discern the national situation and the exigencies of the times, and without causing unnecessary disturbance, each settle in your respective occupations and obey the civilized new governance of the Empire of Japan, thereby sharing in its happiness. This action of Ours today is not born of forgetting Our people, but truly from a profound desire to save them. All you, Our subjects, must fully understand this intention of Ours.\""

 ww1_japan.4.t: "Japan-Korea Memorandum of 1910"
 ww1_japan.4.d: "In November 1908, Major General Akashi Motojiro, who was appointed Chief of Staff of the Imperial Japanese Army stationed in Korea, devised a plan to place the police organizations of the Korean Empire under the Japanese gendarmerie. This year, Akashi requested to Terauchi Masatake, the Resident-General of Korea, that the Korean Empire's policing authority be stripped, arguing that it would be difficult for the military commander to lead if the gendarmerie and police organizations were not unified. This was pursued even more actively when he was appointed Commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie stationed in Korea in June 1910.\nHowever, this plan was thwarted at a regular cabinet meeting of the Korean Empire due to opposition from figures such as Minister of Finance Ko Yeong-hui and Minister of Education Yi Yong-sik. They demanded that a memorandum be written, similar to when Korea's judicial and prison affairs were handed over to Japan.\nSubsequently, Bak Jesun, acting Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs, and Resident-General signed a memorandum. In accordance with this memorandum, Korea's policing authority was transferred to Japan, and Japanese gendarmes began to exert coercive control over Koreans."

 ww1_japan.6.d: "Over the past half-century, our nation has undergone a series of sophisticated reforms to shed its Asian identity and become a European power. Despite numerous twists and turns, including civil wars, coups, and conflicts with China and Russia, we have built a formidable state. Now, it is time for us to secure the colonies befitting a true imperial power. Since 1905, we have stripped the Korean Empire of its diplomatic rights and directed it as a protectorate through the Resident-General. The time has now come to fully annex the Korean Empire into our own imperial territory. They already lack an army and diplomacy, and their economy is dominated by our currency and merchants. Most of their remaining officials are either powerless or collaborators sympathetic to our cause. Any organizations that resisted our forces with arms were completely suppressed in last year's grand punitive operation. All that remains is to secure the Korean Emperor's seal to sign the annexation."

 ww1_japan.7.d: "The Kempeitai have arrested several individuals identified as anarcho-socialists, suspected of plotting terrorist activities. Subsequent investigations uncovered a conspiracy to assassinate members of the Imperial Family, possibly including the Emperor himself. While the plot was foiled before it could be carried out, the incident has led to a crackdown on leftist and anarchist groups, significantly weakening their influence within the Imperial Diet and society at large."

 ww1_japan.8.d: "Unthinkable chaos has erupted across the Korean peninsula. Coinciding with the upcoming state funeral of the former King Gojong, Prince Yi, massive crowds gathered in Keijo under the guise of mourning. However, at Pagoda Park, Korean ethnic leaders brazenly read a 'Declaration of Independence' and the streets were instantly flooded with hidden Korean flags.\nThey are influenced by following  the end of the Great War and the spread of independence, anti-war, and anti-colonial ideas among peoples around the world, millions of Koreans—from peasants to intellectuals—are marching in unison, shouting 'Manse (Long Live Korean Independence)!'. What began as non-violent demonstrations is rapidly overwhelming our local Gendarmerie stations. The governor-general reports that the administration is paralyzed. If this 'Manse' virus spreads any further, we risk losing control of the entire colony. We must respond with an iron fist immediately."

 ww1_japan.14.t: "Hirohito's Regency"
 ww1_japan.14.d: "Having returned from a six-month tour of Europe, Crown Prince Hirohito, then 20 years old, formally assumed the regency and became known as the 'Regent Prince' (Sesshō-no-miya). This significant transition was necessitated by Emperor Taisho's severely deteriorating health, which rendered him unable to perform state duties effectively. From the early years of his reign, the Emperor suffered from immense stress due to a rigorous official schedule and the confining nature of court life. After recuperating from pneumonia in 1913, his health briefly improved. However, the surge in official duties and stress rapidly accelerated his decline. By 1915, he exhibited speech impediments and unnatural movements, by 1917, he was barely able to conduct official business, and by 1919, a cerebral illness prevented him from even reading imperial edicts.\nThe Emperor's physical frailty led to a weakening of his authority. Genrō statesmen, frequently disregarded the Emperor's will and intervened in political affairs. Furthermore, propositions like Professor Ikki Kitokuro's 'Emperor as an Organ Theory' further eroded the Emperor's political standing. Amidst this atmosphere, in 1921, the Imperial Household Ministry officially acknowledged that there was no hope for the Emperor's recovery, and discussions for a regency intensified. Although Emperor Taisho reportedly expressed displeasure over the regency discussions, Hirohito ultimately had to assume the duties of the Emperor. Consequently, Emperor Taisho became imprinted in the public's mind as the 'frail Emperor'."

The heavy taxes imposed to fund the war and the disappointing results of the Portsmouth Treaty fueled public dissatisfaction. Furthermore, social unrest, such as the High Treason Incident, exacerbated public fatigue and criticism of Katsura's prolonged leadership.

Discontent over the post-Russo-Japanese War financial strain, the Manchurian Railway concessions, and large-scale tax increases burdening the populace had already reached its breaking point. Criticism of Prime Minister Katsura's prolonged tenure and autocratic style intensified even further.\nThe press fiercely attacked the Katsura Cabinet, and demonstrations and riots became constant in the capital. Citizens advocating for constitutional government flocked around the Diet building, and some radical protesters even resorted to violence, assaulting pro-government newspaper offices. The situation spiraled out of control, and the government lost its ability to restore order. Ultimately, under unforeseen direct public pressure and the Emperor's decision, the Katsura Cabinet was tragically forced to dissolve."

 ww1_japan.18.d: "The Saionji Kinmochi Cabinet faces a difficult situation, pursuing fiscal austerity due to the immense financial burden incurred after the Russo-Japanese War. However, even under these circumstances, the Army has presented a strong demand. The Ministry of the Army is requesting substantial budgetary support for the expansion of two additional divisions for imperial defense.\nThe Army emphasizes the instability of the international situation surrounding Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, stressing the urgent need to strengthen ground forces for continental defense. However, given the already strained national finances, the cabinet finds it difficult to afford the enormous budget required for a two-division expansion.\nComplicating the situation is the 'military ministers being active-duty officers system' (Gunbu Daijin Gen'eki Bukan Sei), which constitutionally mandates that the Army Minister must be an active-duty general or lieutenant general. If the Army's demands are accepted, national finances will collapse, imposing an immense burden on the populace. However, refusing the Army's request could pose a severe threat, as the Army Minister could resign and the Army could refuse to nominate a successor, effectively toppling the cabinet. This would significantly jeopardize the cabinet's stability."

Recently, the Ministry of the Navy has strongly called for the additional construction of two state-of-the-art ships, citing national security.\nThe Navy argues that Japan's naval defense capabilities must be strengthened to counter the growing naval power of other great powers. However, given the already strained national finances, the cabinet finds it difficult to readily accept the demand for battleship construction, which would require an enormous budget. Accepting the Navy's demands would further worsen fiscal health and undoubtedly lead to increased burdens on the populace. Yet, refusing would escalate military dissatisfaction to its peak, potentially jeopardizing the cabinet's stability."

Facing immense financial strain and growing public discontent, Minister of Army Uehara Yusaku has informed the cabinet of his intention to resign if his demand is not met.\nThis is no mere personal resignation. Under the system, the Army Minister must be an active-duty military officer. If the Army refuses to nominate a successor, the cabinet will be unable to fill the position, forcing it to resign en masse. Uehara's resignation threat is, in effect, an ultimatum to the cabinet, maximizing the Army's political leverage. How this crisis is handled will determine the fate of the cabinet."

 ww1_japan.21.t: "Third Katsura Cabinet"
 ww1_japan.21.d: "The Saionji Kinmochi Cabinet faced deep conflicts with the military over financial and defense issues. In particular, Minister of War Uehara Yusaku directly appealed to the Emperor (jikiso) and resigned without consulting the Prime Minister, to push for the expansion of two army divisions. This incident, combined with the military ministers being active-duty officers system (gen'eki bukan sei), led to the cabinet's loss of control over the military and severe military intervention in politics. Ultimately, the Saionji Cabinet dissolved under military pressure and internal discord.\nAmidst this turmoil, Katsura Tarō formed his third cabinet, once again taking the helm of government. He shoulders the immense task of political stability and national unity, but his path ahead is fraught with challenges. Severe financial difficulties, the need to redefine relations with the military, the growing constitutional movement, and the public's deep distrust and his low popularity all await him."

 ww1_japan.22.t: "Kōtoku Incident Executions"
 ww1_japan.22.d: "Last year, 26 individuals, including the Japanese anarcho-socialist Kōtoku Shusui, were arrested on charges of conspiring to assassinate the Emperor, marking the beginning of what became known as the 'High Treason Incident' or 'Kōtoku Incident'. The trial proceeded in utmost secrecy, and despite the evidence being primarily circumstantial, few days ago, the Supreme Court sentenced 24 individuals, including Kōtoku Shusui, to death. While 12 of them had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by imperial decree, remaining 12 is planned to execute. This group included Kōtoku Shusui, physician Ōishi Seinosuke, and Buddhist monk Uchiyama Gudō. The sole female defendant sentenced to death, Kanno Sugako, is also included.\nThere is few criticism that the authorities largely exploited this incident as a pretext to suppress dissidents. In reality, only about five or six individuals among those indicted and convicted were genuinely involved in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Even the main defendant, Kotoku Shusui, was not involved in the conspiracy's initial stages but became a key target for the prosecution due to his prominent reputation.\nThe Kōtoku Incident is also indirectly linked to the 'Red Flag Incident' of 1908. The Red Flag Incident involved a suppression of socialists who demonstrated with red flags in Tokyo in 1908, leading to the arrest of many socialists and anarchists. During the investigation of the Kōtoku Incident, anarchists already imprisoned from the Red Flag Incident, such as Ōsugi Sakae, Sakai Toshihiko, and Yamakawa Hitoshi, were questioned regarding their potential involvement. Despite being acquitted in the Red Flag trial, Kanno Sugako was tragically implicated in the Kōtoku Incident, arrested, and sentenced to death. This series of events significantly deepened the suppression of thought and ideology within Japanese society."

Furthermore, the Government-General of Chōsen become the supreme commander of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy stationed on the Korean Peninsula, and, by delegation, could issue Government-General ordinances, commands, and impose additional penalties.

 ww1_japan.34.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] stands at a crucial juncture, preparing to discuss the Third Japan-Russia Agreement to redefine its relationship with Russia. Following our victory in the Russo-Japanese War, we solidified its position in East Asia, but potential Russian threats and competition for influence in mainland China persist. With China experiencing instability because of the recent revolution, we think the need to divide their spheres of influence in Inner Mongolia. The Minister of Foreign Affairs aims to clearly delineate Western Inner Mongolia as Russia's sphere of influence and Eastern Inner Mongolia as Japan's. This will be a pivotal stabilization measure for our continental policy. The Ministry is ready to propose official talks to Russia, expecting this negotiation to significantly impact the establishment of a new order in East Asia."
 ww1_japan.34.a: "Proceed with talks with Russia."
 ww1_japan.35.t: "Third Japan-Russia Agreement Proposal"
 ww1_japan.35.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] proposed for the Third Japan-Russia Agreement. We faces complex challenges in Europe, particularly the Balkan issue and domestic revolutionary instability. In this situation, a stable relationship with Japan in East Asia is essential to avoid any possible threat. Considering the chaos in Inner Mongolia due to Chinese Revolution, a clear division of spheres of influence with Japan would benefit our Far Eastern security. However, some hardliners express skepticism about Japanese proposal, recalling the humiliation of the Russo-Japanese War. Russia is carefully considering whether improving relations with Japan aligns with its national interests and how the adjustment of Inner Mongolian interests will affect its long-term strategy."
 ww1_japan.35.a: "Accept the proposal."
 ww1_japan.35.b: "Reject the proposal."
 ww1_japan.36.t: "Russian Rejection"
 ww1_japan.36.d: "News has arrived that the Russian Empire has rejected the proposal for the Third Japan-Russia Agreement. This outcome differs from the Empire of Japan's diplomatic calculations and will cast a chill over bilateral relations. Japan must thoroughly analyze why Russia made this choice and completely re-evaluate its diplomatic strategy in East Asia. The failure to divide spheres of influence in Inner Mongolia could intensify instability in the region, disrupting Japan's continental expansion plans."

 ww1_japan.37.t: "Considering Additional Indemnity Demands"
 ww1_japan.37.d: "Russia has agreed to the Third Japan-Russia Agreement! This strengthens existing secret agreements between the two nations and, crucially, formalizes the division of Eastern (Japan) and Western (Russia) spheres of influence in Inner Mongolia. This is considered our diplomatic victory, solidifying its northern borders and its foundation for continental expansion in China. But should we stop there? An opportunity has arisen to demand additional indemnity from Russia, an amount not fully collected after the 1904 Russo-Japanese War, in Treaty of Portsmouth. While this could alleviate our financial burden and strengthen its national power, it's a risky gamble that might sour the newly improved bilateral relations. Careful consideration is required."

 ww1_japan.38.t: "The Third Japan-Russia Agreement Concluded!"
 ww1_japan.38.d: "Finally, the Third Japan-Russia Agreement has been successfully concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire! This agreement reinforces existing secret treaties and, critically, clearly defines the Eastern (Japan) and Western (Russia) spheres of influence in Inner Mongolia. This marks a significant milestone in managing the complex East Asian situation, coordinating the interests of both nations, and preventing potential conflicts. Through this, Japan has further solidified the stability of its northern borders and its base for continental expansion, securing interests in the volatile Inner Mongolia region after the establishment of the Republic of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that this agreement is expected to positively impact both nations and contribute to peace in East Asia."
 ww1_japan.38.a: "Let's celebrate the agreement's conclusion."
 ww1_japan.39.t: "Japan Demands Additional Indemnity"
 ww1_japan.39.d: "Immediately after, Japan demanded additional indemnity for the Russo-Japanese War. This news has sparked shock and anger. There are criticisms that Japan is unilaterally disrupting the cooperative relationship that was so difficult to achieve. Particularly with the escalating pressure on the European front, Their demand places a significant burden on us. Although we faces difficult domestic and international circumstances, it is uncertain whether it will simply accept Japan's humiliating demand. We must make a crucial decision between national pride and practical gain."

 ww1_japan.41.t: "Failed Agreement, Growing Russian Suspicion"
 ww1_japan.41.d: "With the breakdown of negotiations with Russia, strong suspicion and anti-Russian sentiment are rapidly spreading throughout Japan. Russia, once seen as a potential collaborator for East Asian stability, is now re-emerging as a significant threat. The press and public opinion condemn Russia's unyielding expansionist ambitions, even after the Russo-Japanese War, and demand strong action from the government. As the potential for renewed conflict over interests in Manchuria and Mongolia intensifies, we are seriously contemplating whether to prepare for another military confrontation with Russia. The government stands at a critical crossroads on how to respond to this public sentiment."

 ww1_japan.42.t: "Dismay on Japan-Russia Agreement Failure"
 ww1_japan.42.d: "News of the final breakdown of the agreement between Japan and Russia has reached London, causing deep dismay within the British Empire. In Europe, efforts to establish an anti-German front through the Triple Entente (Britain-France-Russia) are accelerating. At such a time, Japan, as an ally, worsening its relations with Russia directly clashes with Britain's strategic plans. The Foreign Office is concerned that Japan is unnecessarily provoking Russia, escalating tensions in East Asia, and potentially fracturing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The government is deliberating whether to send a message to Japan expressing strong displeasure and demanding a more cautious approach."
 ww1_japan.42.a: "Express strong displeasure to Japan."
 ww1_japan.43.t: "Allied Reprimand"
 ww1_japan.43.d: "A stern reprimand regarding the breakdown of the Japan-Russia agreement has been delivered from the British Empire. Britain criticized us for unnecessarily provoking Russia and destabilizing East Asia, claiming it negatively impacts Britain's European strategy. However, strong opposition to this British stance is rising within politics. Voices are growing, asserting that "Japan holds supremacy in Asia after the Russo-Japanese War, and Britain is attempting to interfere with our continental policy for its own European interests." Meanwhile, anti-Russian sentiment remains high, leading to a convergence of discontent towards both Britain and Russia, further escalating our nationalist sentiment. Despite its ally Britain's reprimand, the government appears determined to adhere to its independent course."

Although limited, Saionji demonstrated a respectful attitude towards party politics even during this period. Now, he once again takes the prime ministerial seat, seeking to uphold his conviction in the development of constitutional government and the establishment of party politics.\nHowever, formidable challenges still lie ahead, including unstable national finances, a military constantly seeking to expand its influence, and a rapidly changing international environment. Can he navigate these turbulent waters and guide Japan towards stability and progress?"
 ww1_japan.44.a: "Embrace the dawn of a new era."
 ww1_japan.45.t: "Decision on the Issue of Military Expansion"
 ww1_japan.45.d: "Prime Minister Katsura decided to freeze the discussion on the expansion of two army divisions and the increase of naval ships—the direct cause of the collapse of the previous cabinet. Instead, he proposed holding a National Defense Council to the Army and Navy for further deliberation.\nIf former Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi is regarded as the representative of the majority party in the House of Representatives, then Prime Minister Katsura can be seen as the representative of the Hanbatsu (Meiji Oligarchy) or Gunbatsu (military clique). While the Army, which was dominated by Katsura's own Chōshū Domain, accepted the proposal, the Navy, dominated by the rival Satsuma Domain and constantly clashing with the Army, opposed this decision. Due to the system requiring military ministers to be active-duty officers, the cabinet could face difficulties if the Naval Minister position became vacant, as happened with the last cabinet. A decisive action is thus needed to appease the Navy's dissatisfaction."
 ww1_japan.45.a: "We can overcome anything with an Imperial Rescript from His Majesty the Emperor."
 ww1_japan.46.t: "Retention of the Naval Minister by Imperial Rescript"
 ww1_japan.46.d: "Prime Minister Katsura petitioned the Emperor and received an Imperial Rescript commanding the retention of Naval Minister Saitō Makoto. While this move did not completely suppress the Navy's underlying dissatisfaction, as it was an order from the Emperor, no one in Japan would dare to defy it. However, criticism is already mounting against the Prime Minister and the cabinet, accusing them of using the Emperor to manipulate national affairs."
 ww1_japan.46.a: "Not to worry."
 ww1_japan.47.t: "New Party Push and Seiyūkai's Split"
 ww1_japan.47.d: "Prime Minister Katsura has initiated the formation of a new political party to stabilize national affairs. His intention is to resolve political conflicts by establishing a powerful conservative Two-Party System to check the Min-tō, the popular parties in the House of Representatives.\nHowever, this plan has backfired. The Cabinet initially operated with the unofficial support of the Seiyūkai, the constitutionalists which held the parliamentary majority. But they viewed Katsura's use of Imperial authority and his attempt to form a rival party as a move to reinforce the Hanbatsu, the oligarchic domain cliques. Consequently, the Seiyūkai has formally withdrawn its support and joined the opposition. This defection by the majority party has dealt a fatal blow, leaving the cabinet powerless in the Diet."
 ww1_japan.47.a: "A decisive action for the nation."
 ww1_japan.48.t: "The Constitutional Protection Movement Ignites"
 ww1_japan.48.d: "The withdrawal of the Seiyūkai support has triggered a major political realignment. Now acting as the constitutionalists, they have formed a united front with Inukai Tsuyoshi's Kokumintō, the Nationalist Party. Rallying under the banner of \"Destroy the Cliques, Protect Constitutional Government,\" leaders like Ozaki Yukio are fiercely attacking the Cabinet's legitimacy.\nThis opposition movement is rapidly spreading beyond the Diet. Journalists and intellectuals are amplifying the anti-government sentiment, while merchants and citizens in Tokyo are beginning to echo the call for the Cabinet's resignation. Faced with a unified opposition and a turning tide of public opinion, the Katsura administration is under immense pressure."
 ww1_japan.48.a: "What are all these rioters?"
 ww1_japan.49.t: "Dōshikai and No Confidence"
 ww1_japan.49.d: "Cornered by the opposition, Prime Minister Katsura played his final card by announcing the formation of the Rikken Dōshikai, the Association of Allies of the Constitution. He hoped to recruit defectors and secure a parliamentary majority to bypass the hostile Diet. However, the opposition's response was swift and merciless.\nThe constitutionalists and the Kokumintō denounced this new party as a tool for the oligarchs and took immediate action. Led by Ozaki Yukio, they have formally submitted a Vote of No Confidence to the Diet. Katsura's maneuver has only served to unite his enemies, and the Cabinet now faces a decisive showdown on the floor of the House."
 ww1_japan.49.a: "The confrontation is inevitable."
 ww1_japan.50.t: "The Diet Suspended"
 ww1_japan.50.d: "Facing an almost certain defeat in the Vote of No Confidence, Prime Minister Katsura has resorted to an Imperial Rescript to suspend the Diet. He secured an order from the Emperor to halt the parliamentary session for five days, effectively locking the doors of the House to prevent the vote.\nHowever, this desperate maneuver has backfired. The opposition and the public are outraged that the Prime Minister is using the Emperor as a shield to survive a political crisis. By attempting to silence the people's representatives with Imperial authority, Katsura has exhausted the patience of the crowds gathering outside the Diet building."
 ww1_japan.50.a: "The Emperor shall decide the matter."
 ww1_japan.51.t: "Hiding Behind the Throne"
 ww1_japan.51.d: "The Seiyūkai and the Kokumintō have jointly submitted a Vote of No Confidence. Amidst the tension, Ozaki Yukio, known as the God of Constitutionalism, took the podium and delivered a historic impeachment speech.\nHe fiercely attacked Prime Minister Katsura and his followers, accusing them of always hiding in the shadow of the Throne to strike at their enemies. Ozaki condemned them for using the Emperor as a political breastwork and firing Imperial Rescripts like bullets to destroy the constitution. This powerful speech electrified not only the opposition members but also the public in the galleries, inflicting a fatal moral wound on the Katsura Cabinet."

 ww1_japan.52.d: "News of Ozaki's speech and the No Confidence Motion has turned the streets of Tokyo into a battlefield. Tens of thousands of angry protesters have surrounded the Diet building, chanting "Destroy the Hanbatsu." The mob has begun to use force, attacking pro-government newspaper offices and burning police boxes.\nThe police attempted to form a perimeter but were helpless against the overwhelming numbers. Prime Minister Katsura and his supporters are effectively trapped inside the Diet, unable to leave. The public fury has escalated beyond political demands; the people are now physically enforcing their will for the Cabinet's immediate resignation."
 ww1_japan.52.a: "No way out?"
 ww1_japan.53.t: "Rescript or Dissolution"
 ww1_japan.53.d: "The order to suspend the Diet was merely a delaying tactic. The roar outside the Parliament has grown louder, and the opposition shows no signs of retreating. Prime Minister Katsura is now left with two divergent paths.\nHe can petition the Throne once more for a powerful Imperial Rescript to forcibly subdue the dissenters. This would neutralize the Diet and concentrate absolute power in the hands of the Prime Minister. Alternatively, he can follow constitutional procedures to dissolve the Diet and gamble his fate on an uncertain election. Choosing the former would shatter constitutional norms and pave the way for a new, centralized authoritarian order."

Admitting that governing is no longer possible, he has submitted his resignation to the Emperor.\nThus, the Third Katsura Cabinet has collapsed after just 53 days. For the first time in constitutional history, the old style of rule led by the Hanbatsu oligarchs has been toppled by the power of the people. While the victory of the Movement to Protect Constitutional Government has set a new milestone in Japanese politics, the power vacuum remains unfilled.\nDespite the news of the Cabinet's resignation, the heat in the streets has not dissipated. Empowered by their victory, crowds continue to occupy Tokyo, and attacks on pro-government newspapers and police stations persist.\nThis unrest signifies a political awakening beyond mere rioting; the people have realized that their actions can topple a government. While security forces struggle to restore order, the citizens' demands are becoming more specific and bold. The Genrō, the elder statesmen, are scrambling to find a successor capable of soothing this angry public sentiment."

With public hostility towards the Army-dominated Chōshū clique at its peak, a Navy man was the only alternative to avert popular fury.\nPrime Minister Yamamoto recognized that the cabinet could not survive without parliamentary support. He actively compromised with the Seiyūkai, appointing party members to all ministerial posts except for the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry. Although not a full party cabinet, this coalition has brought party politicians into the mainstream of government, gradually restoring stability to the nation."

President Hara Takashi accepted the offer for pragmatic reasons and entered the cabinet as Home Minister, but the backlash within the party was severe. Hardliners led by Ozaki Yukio, known as the "God of Constitutionalism," condemned the move as a "dirty illicit union with the military clique" and announced their departure from the party.

He has amended the Military Ministers from Active Duty Rule (Gungun-kitei), which previously mandated that only active-duty generals or lieutenant generals could serve as Army or Navy Ministers. Now, officers in the reserve or retired lists are also eligible.\nThis measure aims to block the Army General Staff's notorious tactic of toppling cabinets by resigning or refusing to nominate a minister. While the Army and the Chōshū clique are fiercely resisting, Yamamoto is pushing through this reform backed by his alliance with the Seiyūkai."

Premier Yamamoto Gonnohyoe has finally assumed responsibility for the situation and announced the resignation of the cabinet. The Tiger of Satsuma exits lonely, and Genrō Yamagata Aritomo has nominated his confidant, Kiyoura Keigo, as the next Prime Minister designate. Seizing the opportunity of the Satsuma Navy's fall, the Choshu faction and bureaucratic forces seek to regain power. Backed by the "Kenkyukai" faction of the House of Peers, Kiyoura has begun forming his cabinet. His primary goal is to slash the budget of the corrupt Navy and restore discipline."

His hint at cutting naval budgets provoked organized sabotage from the Navy, which refused to nominate a minister, leaving his government "stillborn" before it could even launch. As Kiyoura returned the mandate in humiliation, the desperate Genrō played their final card to fill the political vacuum: the 76-year-old "Sage of Waseda," Ōkuma Shigenobu. Emerging from retirement to salvage a nation in moral crisis, Ōkuma was enthusiastically welcomed by a public weary of corrupt cliques.

In contrast to her predecessors, the ship was armed with numerous main battery guns with a longer firing range. Turbine-driven propulsion could produce quite a decent speed for a dreadnought."
 USA_battleship_3:0 "New York Class"
 USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "Developed from the Wyoming class. In contrast to her predecessor, she featured reinforced armor and main battery guns of a larger caliber. When upgraded, she received reasonably good AA defense and improved torpedo protection."
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Colorado Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "She became the final phase in development of conventional battleships that featured very heavy armor protection for the vitally important parts of a ship. Key differences from her predecessors were her 406mm main guns and a novel torpedo protection system. In speed, she was outclassed by other battleships of her 

 ITA_battleship_0:0 "Regina Margherita Class"
 ITA_battleship_0_desc:0 "The Regina Margherita-class battleships, completed between 1904 and 1905, were a class of Italian pre-dreadnoughts emphasizing speed. They were armed with four 30.5 cm (12 inch) guns and twelve 15.2 cm (6 inch) guns. Their design reflected a balance between firepower, protection, and a relatively high speed for their era, but still adhered to the pre-dreadnought standard."

 JAP_battleship_0:0 "Satsuma Class"
 JAP_battleship_0_desc:0 "The Satsuma-class battleships, completed in 1910, were the first battleships designed and laid down in Japan. While originally intended to feature a uniform main battery of twelve 30.5 cm (12 inch) guns, effectively making them "all-big-gun" ships before HMS Dreadnought was completed, budget limitations led to them being completed with a mixed armament of four 30.5 cm (12 inch) guns and twelve 25.4 cm (10 inch) guns. This made them powerful pre-dreadnoughts with a heavy secondary battery, but still subject to the tactical limitations of mixed-caliber designs once the true dreadnought era began."
 JAP_battleship_1:0 "Kawachi Class"
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first dreadnought of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Boasted a sufficiently powerful armor belt. Kawachi’s fire control capabilities were strongly affected by the diversity of calibers of her numerous guns. Similar to other warships of her time, Kawachi had insufficient horizontal armor protection and weak torpedo protection."
 JAP_battleship_2:0 "Fusō Class"
 JAP_battleship_2_desc:0 "One of the mightiest battleships of her time. When built, Fuso was the largest warship in the world. She had a fairly powerful artillery and reasonably heavy armor."
 JAP_battleship_3:0 "Nagato Class"
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "Nagato had long remained the most powerful warship in the Imperial Japanese Navy. She had good armor and carried 410mm main battery guns. In the 1930s, the ship was modernized to receive more powerful torpedo protection."
 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Tosa Class"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "Tosa-class battleships were larger versions of the preceding Nagato class, and carried an additional twin-gun 41 cm turret."

 RUS_battleship_0:0 "Borodino Class"
 RUS_battleship_0_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battleships, completed just before and during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), represented some of the most advanced Russian pre-dreadnoughts. They carried four 30.5 cm (12 inch) guns and twelve 15.2 cm (6 inch) guns. Their tragic performance during the Battle of Tsushima highlighted many of the inherent weaknesses of pre-dreadnought designs, particularly against a well-trained and focused naval force, and contributed to the shift towards dreadnought designs."
 RUS_battleship_1:0 "Sevastopol Class"
 RUS_battleship_1_desc:0 "Sevastopol-class was part of the first series of dreadnought battleships built in Russia. She was armed with twelve main battery guns. The ship's features included a significant area of side armor and a general layout providing a full sideboard salvo at the widest possible angles."
 RUS_battleship_2:0 "Imperatritsa Mariya Class"
 RUS_battleship_3:0 "Imperator Nikolai I Class"
 RUS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The last battleship laid down for the Imperial Russian Navy. Developed from the Imperatritsa Mariya-class battleships, she inherited high firepower from her predecessors. Experience gained in building early Russian dreadnoughts helped to significantly reinforce the ship's armor which received an advanced arrangement."

 early_gas_mask:0 "Early Gas Mask"
 early_gas_mask_desc:0 "A hastily developed gas mask. Essential for resisting gas attacks. Its minimalist design makes it relatively unreliable."
 improved_gas_mask:0 "Improved Gas Mask"
 improved_gas_mask_desc:0 "An advanced gas mask model, featuring good insulation and quality filters. It provides resistance to combat gases while causing minimal discomfort to the wearer. However, it remains vulnerable, especially if the filter is not changed regularly."
 combat_respirator:0 "Combat Respirator"
 combat_respirator_desc:0 "Box respirators used a two-piece design; a mouthpiece connected via a hose to a box filter. The box filter contained granules of chemicals that neutralised the gas. This is the most advanced gas mask, guaranteeing a perfect viability of the wearer."
 poisonous_cylinder_gas_tech:0 "Poisonous Gas Cylinder Releaser"
 poisonous_cylinder_gas_tech_desc:0 "A large quantity of tear gas was transported in large barrels that were punctured, releasing the product towards enemy lines. Sensitive to wind changes, these chemicals are the first experiments in the field."
 poisonous_gas_shell_tech:0 "Poisonous Gas Shell"
 poisonous_gas_shell_tech_desc:0 "A lethal version of the tear gas shell, with more impact on enemy lines."
 poisonous_gas_projector_tech:0 "Poisonous Gas Projector"
 poisonous_gas_projector_tech_desc:0 "A lethal version of the tear gas projector, with more impact on enemy lines."

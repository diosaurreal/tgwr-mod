ww1_holland.1.t: "Failed Coup in Suriname!"
ww1_holland.1.d: "This morning, the 23rd of May, several police officers were arrested in Suriname. Their ringleader, Franz Killinger, was a police officer as of last month and conspired to coup the colonial government. He planned to install himself as President-Dictator and gain the support of the relevant Great Powers of the region in order to secure his rule. His plan had many working parts, almost all of which had a high chance of failing; and eventually one did. A former police-officer turned baker who was initially part of the plan had a change of heart after discussing the matter with his priest. He turned Killinger and several others into the police meaning that the coup was totally and utterly foiled."

Dutch police were quick to reinforce cities facing mass protests with police officers, however, who swiftly rounded up and arrested socialist agitators. Either way, the failed revolt has caused panic amongst Western European governments, who have previously assumed there was little chance at revolt in their nations."

ww1_italy.369.t: "Fate of the PSI"
ww1_italy.369.d: "Recent events have made it clear that the PSI is no regular political party, its a subversive element attempting to destroy the state and the Kingdom itself. We need to fight back against them, though the way to fight back could very dramatically depending on our goals. There is a large plurality of socialists who do accept the monarchy and who oppose violent activites of the maximalist wing of the PSI, and maybe they should have their place in Italian politics. What should the fate of the PSI be?"
ww1_italy.369.a: "Let's simply target the maximalists and anarchists"
ww1_italy.369.b: "Criminalize the PSI, immediately"
ww1_iw_italy.1.t: "The Guns Fall Silent"
ww1_iw_italy.1.d: "After a brutal war lasting years longer then even the most pessimistic predictions, we've come out victorious. While one of the greatest triumphs in our nations history, the people at home hardly feel any especially patriotic feelings right now, only glad that the war that has drastically worsened their lifes has finally come to a close. The duration of the war saw inflation soar more then 400%, food shortages spread across the nation, historic levels of labour unrest, and hundreds of thousands of lifes lost. Although we've won, the streets of Italian cities hardly look like a nation thats won anything, and recovery is going to be a long and hard process."
ww1_italy.424.t: "Italy Open to Negotiating Entry on Our Side"
ww1_italy.424.d: "Although declaring neutrality at the start of the war, Italy seems to be coming around to the idea of turning their army west into France. However, they seek several concessions from us, the specific details of which should be relayed to us soon."
ww1_italy.424.a: "This should be unconditional!"
ww1_italy.426.t: "Italy's Non-Starters in France"
ww1_italy.426.d: "The Italian delegation to Berlin has presented its initial demands in France. They seek Haute Savony as well as Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, and French lands in East Africa. These were all expected to be Italian demands, and don't really conflict with our interests, so we're ready to give into Italy's demands here. We can only hope future demands from them aren't unreasonable."
ww1_italy.426.a: "Of course!"
ww1_italy.427.t: "Germany Agrees to Demands in France"
ww1_italy.427.d: "German leaders have agreed to our initial requests in France, unsuprisingly to any in our government. We can now move onto our requests from the United Kingdom."
ww1_italy.427.a: "Let's go for it!"
ww1_iw_br_italy.23.t: "Entente Mission to the Adriatic Coast"
ww1_iw_br_italy.23.d: "The rapid dissolution of the Austrian empire has came to a suprise to much of the Entente. The general plan post war was that an Austro-Hungarian state would exist, grant concessions to entente neighbors, and would become a secondary power in Europe. With the empire collapsing into various new ethnic states, the entente has had to formulate a quick reaction. To secure stability in the adriatic coast, a coalition of the willing has been assembled to occupy costal cities and prevent the outbreak of ethnic violence. This occupation is expected to be temporary as the Entente decides the future of who will own what on the adriatic coast, especially as tensions between Italy and Serbia ramp up over their differing vision on the future of the balkans."
ww1_iw_br_italy.23.a: "A necessary operation to secure peace."
ww1_iw_italy.1.a: "We won the war. Now, let's win the peace."
ww1_italy.376.t: "Home Front Deteriorating"
ww1_italy.376.d: "With the war entering its second year, situations on the homefront are continuing to worse for Italians. Inflation is at all time highs, bread is unaffordable, and Italians simply aren't feeling patriotic. As the war continues, the demands for food for our soldiers are increasing, the deficit continues to be out of control, and people are being streched thin."
ww1_italy.376.a: "Just give us a few months!"
ww1_italy.378.t: "Rationing Programs Slowing Down"
ww1_italy.378.d: "As the situation at home continues to worse, rationing programs at home are running into shortages. As many predicted, we only had enough food reserves to last around 2 years, and as we cross that time period, our stockpiled grains and cereals are running out. Combined with continued poor harvests, food shortages are worsening."
ww1_italy.378.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_red_italy.101.t: "Ending of Northern Preference"
ww1_red_italy.101.d: "Since the start of the Risorgimento, Italy's government has shown extreme bias towards the north. Focusing industrial and infrastructure projects in the north, implementing tariffs that favored the north and hurt the south, as well as being much more violent to protesting southerners compared to northerners are just the tip of the iceberg. These policies have build lot's of resentment between the north and south, and while it won't be fixed overnight, ending these policies is a good beginning."
ww1_red_italy.101.a: "One day the north and the south will have more in common with eachother"
ww1_italy.377.t: "PSI Winning the Propaganda War"
ww1_italy.377.d: "Although our government is attempting to spread nationalist propaganda and revigorate patriotism amongst Italians, it's not working. As the domestic front continues to worse, Italians are turning to the PSI who claims they would immediantly pull out of the war and help solve the domestic issues at home. As the popularity of the PSI grows, so does the revolutionary wing, who is threatening a revolution soon."
ww1_italy.377.a: "Not good!"
ww1_red_italy.87.t: "Italian Farmers Land Seized in Somalia "
ww1_red_italy.87.d: "Following the collapse of Italian control in East Africa in the wake of the civil war, East Africas new owners have began seizing farm land from Italian settlers and distributing it to locals in the area, with alleged targeted murderings of Italian settlers also being reported. Although we're hardly in a place to intervene, we've set up generous resettling programs in Italy for those fleeing persecution."
ww1_red_italy.87.a: "Is this a white genocide?"
ww1_red_italy.10.t: "Fate of Article Five"
ww1_red_italy.8.d: "With the rewriting of the constitution, article 1 has obviously got to go. Stating that "The Kingdom of Sardinia is a monarchy hereditary according to the Salic law." Deleting this line is a no brainer as we work towards establishing a socialist state with equality for everyone."
ww1_red_italy.8.a: "The age of monarchism in Italy is over!"
ww1_red_italy.9.t: "Fate of Article Two"
ww1_red_italy.9.d: "Article 2 reads "The state is Catholic. Other religions now existing are tolerated according to the laws." We are going to abolish this, obviously, but there is a question on what the line should be replaced with. Many autonomists in the government wish to see Italy declared a secular republic, with freedom of religion guaranteed for all. Some centralists however wish to see more forceful language used, to ensure the state can go after the church if needed."
ww1_red_italy.9.a: "We must guarantee freedom of religion for all!"
ww1_red_italy.9.b: "We must guarantee freedom of religion for all... citizens!"
ww1_red_italy.8.t: "Fate of Article One"
ww1_red_italy.14.t: "Unions Assert Dominance"
ww1_red_italy.14.d: "A great schism has occured in the socialist government between localist, syndicalist, and anarchist forces against state supremacists and maximalists. For weeks, leadership of the new state was heavily contested. Unions across Italy have threatened a second revolution if they feel their rights are being trambled by a strong federal government, and, using their large leverage, have suceeded in dominating leadership elections. Centralists have stepped aside and now we must decide Italy's next prime minister. "
ww1_red_italy.14.a: "A victory for our freedom!"
ww1_italy.373.t: "Socialist Propaganda Decreases our Citizens and Soldiers Morale"
ww1_italy.373.d: "Large scale socialist propaganda campaigns have been launched across the nation, and unfortunately the people seem to be falling for the traitors propaganda. Strikes have increased, and we've seen a drop in morale of soldiers."
ww1_italy.373.a: "Socialist bastards!"
ww1_red_italy.10.d: "Article Five currently reads: "The King is the Head of the State: he commands all armed forces by land and sea." Italy obviously does not have a king anymore, and now we must decide who has oversight of the army. Many in the coalition wish to see the army beholdent to local unions and workers councils, while others want the prime minister to control the armed forces. What should we go with?"
ww1_red_italy.10.a: "The workers must control the army!"
ww1_red_italy.10.b: "The army is beholdent to the prime minister"
ww1_red_italy.11.t: "Fate of Article Eight"
ww1_red_italy.11.d: "Article Eight currently reads: "The King convokes the Chambers, and may prorogue them and dissolve them." As is the story for previous articles, the monarchy is abolished. We must now decide if article 8 is worth keeping at all. Some wish to see the prime minister have authority to disolve parliament if necessary, while others want article 8 to be thrown out all together."
ww1_red_italy.11.a: "Nullify Article Eight, its undemocratic"
ww1_red_italy.11.b: "Ammend Article Eight to refer to the prime minister."
ww1_red_italy.12.t: "Fate of Article Twenty One"
ww1_red_italy.12.d: "Article Twenty One currently reads: "The King appoints all officers of the State, and confirms the appointments made by the Ministers." It goes without saying that once again, we are not a monarchy. And once again, we must now decide who will appoint ministers. Some wish to see the prime minister have the power to appoint all ministers, while others wish to see ministers require a threshold of union support."
ww1_red_italy.12.a: "Appointments will require union support"
ww1_red_italy.12.b: "The prime minister will appont ministers"
ww1_red_italy.78.t: "[ITA.GetLeader] Declares A New Parliament"
ww1_red_italy.78.d: "Assuming the power to appoint parliament members, [ITA.GetLeader] has declared a new parliament stacked with only absolute loyalists. With this, a legal dictatorship can be establish with a small council of maximalists assuming control of Italy."
ww1_red_italy.78.a: "Goodbye, parliament!"
ww1_red_italy.79.t: "Parliamentry Members Declare New Parliament Illegal"
ww1_red_italy.79.d: "Opposition groups in parliament have announced they have no plan to hand their seats over to the newly appointed members of parliament, saying the Prime Minister has no authority to do such a thing. They intend to remain in their position no matter what, and to continue governing as a functioning check on the prime ministers powers."
ww1_red_italy.79.a: "Your not even allowed to do that"
ww1_red_italy.80.t: "An Emergency Session"
ww1_red_italy.80.d: "Parliament has gathered in an emergency session, with almost all of parliament that we expelled showing up and refusing to hand over their seats. Their intentions are unknown, but they don't have the legal authority to do anything, considering the fact that illegal parliamentry members are attempting to vote."
ww1_red_italy.80.a: "We will simply arrest them"
ww1_red_italy.90.t: "Fate of Parliament"
ww1_red_italy.90.d: "With our asscension into power, the already whithering power of parliament needs to be dealt with all together. With the expansive powers of the prime minister, we have the power to appoint new parliament members. Thus, a plan to stack parliament with loyalts has been finalized, and can now be enacted."
ww1_red_italy.90.a: "It's all legal"
ww1_red_italy.91.t: "PSI Convention"
ww1_red_italy.91.d: "Elections for the next prime minister of Italy have concluded after Costantino Lazzari resigned his position. Several heavy hitters in the party have declared their intention to become the next prime minister, but there can only be one winner. With all party electors voting, a winner has been chosen. The next prime minister of Italy will be..."
ww1_red_italy.91.a: "Benito Mussolini!"
ww1_red_italy.91.b: "Nicola Bombacci"
ww1_red_italy.81.t: "Parliament Declares Impeachment"
ww1_red_italy.81.d: "In their emergency session, parliament has passed a series of consitution reforms nullifying our new powers and giving them the authority to remove the prime minister, which they immediantly took a vote on to attempt to oust us. While their little roleplay has been fun to watch, they have no authority over us, and we plan to simply arrest them soon."
ww1_red_italy.81.a: "They're funny"
ww1_red_italy.82.t: "Police Sack Parliament"
ww1_red_italy.82.d: "On our order, police have entered parliament and arrested the illegal parliamentry members attempting to occupy the office and pass their own laws. With them gone, the new parliamentry members we appointed have taken their positions, agreeing to meet soon."
ww1_red_italy.82.a: "The traitors are finally gone!"
ww1_red_italy.83.t: "Parliament Abolishes Itself"
ww1_red_italy.83.d: "The new members of parliament have quickly voted to abolish the institution of parliament, giving all power to the executive branch. Rule now lies in the Prime Minister and his tight knit of advisors and minister, instead of a bickering dysfunctional group of 500 men."
ww1_red_italy.83.a: "True democracy achieved!"
ww1_red_italy.84.t: "The Failed March on Rome"
ww1_red_italy.84.d: "Opposition leftist groups have attempted a coup to overthrow our government, motivated by our abolishment of parliament. Their attempt was a pathetic failure, with police and the military easily beating back the rioters, although casualities were Unfortuantely reported. With the utter failure of the attempted coup, we should be relatively safe in our position. No organized group could hope for anything more sucessful then the attempted coup today."
ww1_red_italy.84.a: "Italy is now ours!"
ww1_red_italy.85.t: "Italian Control Collapses in Eritrea!"
ww1_red_italy.85.d: "With the outbreak of civil war in the Italian homeland, Italian control in Eritrea has collapsed with only a small colonial presence facing off the Eritrean masses. These people must be liberated from their colonial oppressors, however, this could cause problems in the future when the Italians are in a more stable state..."
ww1_red_italy.85.a: "Launch an invasion! Liberate Eritrea from colonial oppressors!"
ww1_red_italy.85.b: "We should avoid risking any future backlash"
ww1_red_italy.86.t: "Ethiopians invade Eritrea!"
ww1_red_italy.86.d: "The Ethiopians have taken advantage of our weak colonial presence in Eritrea after the outbreak of civil war and have invaded the colony. This is another extreme embarassment for us against the Ethiopians after being humiliated for our 1896 defeat in Adwa but unfortunately we can't do much at the moment to take back the colony."
ww1_red_italy.88.t: "Mass Exodus of Coporations"
ww1_red_italy.88.d: "With the surrender of royalist forces, corporations have began withdrawing their assets in mass and fled to neighboring capitalist countries. It seems they expect immediate nationalization of their assets and want to prevent them from being seized. The mass exodus has lead to a dramatic shrinkage in our GDP and our industrial capacity."
ww1_red_italy.88.a: "We aren't focused on industrial capacity, we are focused on workers rights!"
ww1_red_italy.86.a: "First Adwa, now this?"
ww1_red_italy.96.t: "Second Ammendment of Article Two"
ww1_red_italy.96.d: "Although the first consitutional convention upon the fall of the monarchy was quite decent, the language used in article two does not go nearly far enough. Luckily, [ITA.GetLeader] can change the consitution with a decree. With these new changes, Italy will finally be the athiestic state [ITA.GetLeader] has dreamed of."
ww1_red_italy.96.a: "Religion has no place in society"
ww1_red_italy.77.t: "Assuming New Powers"
ww1_red_italy.77.d: "While we rewrote most the constitution, there is a few lines left untouch that could be interinterpreted to dramatically increase the power of the prime minister. Articles giving the king power over ministers, election procedures, and appointments of Parliament Members have all been revoked, although no replacement for these articles were made. While most would read it as these powers being abolished completely, we prefer to assume that these articles were simply overlooked, and were meant to be transfered to the prime minister. With no supreme court to rule differently, we can now assume these powers."

ww1_italy.347.t: "Riots Up North"
ww1_italy.347.d: "Our attempts to split the socialist movement not gone unnoticed by socialist organizations up north. While bitterly divided, socialist groups up north of all kinds have began to unite against our attepts to weaken socialist movements in Italy. Anarchists, maximalists, and reformists are all engaging in protests up north with varying levels of violence being reported."

ww1_italy.348.d: "Rioting up north has escalated severly as a few Italian officers clashing with a few pacifist socialist protesters resulted in 3 protesters dying. Our government has claimed that the protesters provoked the situation while the socialists claim that we are unleashing a brutal crackdown on Italians freedoms. The men have became martyrs for socialists up north, with socialist organizations across the country offically declaring themselves on strike."
ww1_italy.349.t: "Independent Communes Declared Across Italy"
ww1_italy.349.d: "Strikes up north have turned revolutionary as nearly a hundred towns up north have offically proclaimed themself as independent communes, with some workers attempting to arm themself. While in reality their little rebellion can hardly be called a civil war, the situation looks like it may be heading that way."

ww1_italy.348.a: "This will blow over"
ww1_red_italy.58.t: "The Threats to Italy"
ww1_red_italy.58.d: "Although we've been relatively tolerant of other ideologies so far, the wave of riots in the south and subsequent events have revealed that such a tolerant position isn't sustainable. If our enemies had their way, our government would be overthrown, and there would be no toleration of us. Thus, we must abandon our previously idealistic policies and start persecuting liberals, conservatives, and nationalists."
ww1_red_italy.58.a: "Our hand is forced"
ww1_italy.353.t: "CGL Endorses The Commune Movement"
ww1_italy.353.d: "Our attempts to reach out to the CGL have completely failed. Our aggressive response to protesters and brutal crackdown by the military has severly alienated their leaders, who now see the rioting anarchists as preferable to our current government. They've outright endorsed overthrowing the government in all but name, and with our leaders wasting time not cracking down on them earlier, they're in a strong position. We may be at risk of a real civil war soon."
ww1_italy.353.a: "We'll have them hanged for this!"
ww1_italy.354.t: "Situation Continues to Esculate With No Government Response"
ww1_italy.354.d: "Our governent has currently done nothing to respond to the active insurection up north. We've refused to send in any army units, and the small police forces up north are completely overrun. With no attempts to open dialogue with top socialist movements, the situation up north is rapidly deteriorating. The very unorganized and chaotic communes that have been declared up north have began to truly organize themselve. It's now clear that we're going to have to put these anarchists down, and it's going to be bloody."
ww1_italy.354.a: "They will learn their lesson!"
ww1_italy.351.d: "The Italian general confederation of labour has no love for our government, but they are also much more moderate compared to many anarchist groups actively trying to overthrow the government up north. If we try and contact them, we may be able to convince them to try call for the anarchists to stand down."
ww1_italy.351.a: "Let's contact them"
ww1_italy.351.b: "They're traitors, too. Ignore them."
ww1_italy.350.d: "Some government officals, worried by the situation up north, have called for us to mobilize the army to put down the rebels up north. They claim it would scare off most protesters and leave the remaining violent rioters vulernable. There are some others in the government who claim this may be too inflamitory however."
ww1_italy.350.a: "Mobilize the army, but have them respond only if provoked"

ww1_italy.352.t: "Red Week Successfully Supressed"
ww1_italy.352.d: "With our consistent response to red week, the rioting and anarchism up north has quickly lost steam. Most protesters up north have gone home, while our response forces have been able to arrest those who attempted to form their own independent communes. Of course, the north is far from stable, but we can now say it's no longer actively rioting against the government."

ww1_italy.359.t: "Right Attempts to Bring Government Down"
ww1_italy.359.d: "The right wing block of Italian politics has made it no secret their despisal for Bissolati's government. With Bissolati propping up unions, the right, no doubt funded by confindustria, is intensifying their attacks on Bissolati. Parliamentry members are making long speeches in parliament raving against our government, attempting to get the king to dismiss us. While so far we're ok, the ramped up attacks are polarizing Italy's parliament."
ww1_italy.361.t: "Right Appeals to the King"
ww1_italy.361.d: "With riots in the south, members of the religious right have met with the king and requested he dismiss the current socialist government, claiming the government is destabilizing the country and removing religious freedoms of Italians. Emmanuel has resisted the many calls so far, but seeing the riots in the south, he is starting to buy into the arguments that Bissolati's government is simply bringing too much change too quickly. What if his reforms push Italy into a civil war?"
ww1_italy.361.a: "These fears are way over exaggerated"

ww1_italy.360.t: "Riots in the South"
ww1_italy.360.d: "Our nationalizing of education has lead to severe backlash in the south. Southern catholics are claiming our government is attempting to remove their religious freedom and destroy the moral fabric of Italy. They've taken to the streets, rioting and even clashing with local education authorities in limited cases."

ww1_italy.345.d: "Running a fairly leftist administartion, certainly the most leftist one Italy has seen in it's modern history, the question of Giolitti's sucessor interested many conservatives, who believed it was their turn to return to power. Unfortunately for them, Giolitti has worked to undermine them, favoring a leftist sucessor instead. Suprising many, Giolitti has met with the king to help propel a PSI member into power as his sucessor. Bissolati, he believes, would ensure that the PSI continues its moderation as it focuses on dealing with its maximist wing. An accomplishment that would greatly stabilize Italian politics."

Arguments on what the post-war government should look like are threatening to tear our coalition apart, and, thus, a compromise has been met: we will keep the current Italian parliament, with snap elections to be held quickly after the war.

ww1_italy.307.d: "Italy currently has a quite high level of financial aid going to it's farmers down south, a level that some are saying may be too high. With our government attempting to save money, there's some calls to cut back on the aid given to farmers. This, of course, would harm some southern farmers, but with the increased demand for their products, some believe they won't go backrupt. What should we do?"
ww1_italy.307.a: "Why would we cut back on their aid in a time where we need their food the most?"
ww1_italy.307.b: "We will cut back on their aid, we need the money"
ww1_italy.184.t: "The Franco-British Threat"
ww1_italy.184.d: "The French have recently ratified a naval treaty with the British, to the great dismay of our government. With Britain and France increasingly becoming close, a war between the central powers and a British backed Entente would surely see the Italian-German-Austrian navies be crushed. This hypothetical has lead to many in the navy to call for an increase in funding, to ensure we could combat any of our potential enemies navies, whether it be French, British, or even Austrian."
ww1_italy.184.a: "They have a convincing argument"
ww1_italy.184.b: "Our current naval funding is sufficient."
ww1_iw_italy.2.t: "Conversion of Military Industries Failing"
ww1_iw_italy.2.d: "Our attempts to transform military industry to civilian industry is not going as planned. Our lack of spare cash is leading to our comversion attempts resulting in factories that simply don't have the modern tools or parts to function properly. Thus, these factories are being left practically useless."

ww1_italy.327.d: "Despite the offical PSI position of being in support of Giolitti, Turati is starting to struggle to enforce party unity on key votes. Radicals such as Bentito Mussolini have been rallying the maximalist wing of the PSI into opposing Giolitti, and they're starting to peel away votes."
ww1_italy.327.a: "He needs to pull himself together!"
ww1_italy.302.t: "Riots in the South"
ww1_italy.302.d: "The war and it's effect on our supply of food is taking its tool on struggling farmers down south. Italian farmers who were already struggling in the light of the poor harvest last year are now being stretched even thinner with the new laws that prioritize food to the army, leaving them with little to eat themselves. Many in the south are resorting to rioting, with demands that we help alleviate their suffering."
ww1_italy.302.a: "We must assist them anyway we can"
ww1_italy.332.t: "Protests Due To The Price Of Milk"
ww1_italy.332.d: "The government currently has a set floor for milk prices to try and avoid huge shortages, and our set prices are being seen as much too high by Italian citizens. Italians, especially mothers, have taken to the streets to demand lower prices for milk, with some resorting to stealing milk."

ww1_italy.308.d: "A disaster has struck Italy: the Austrian enemy has offically gained a foothold in the country. Far from the propaganda that we gave our citizens and soldiers, the war has rapidly turned against our favor. Our allies are furious at our incompentence, and our population is left fearful."
ww1_italy.308.a: "We'll kick them out soon enough"
ww1_italy.259.d: "With winter ending and the weather warming up, Italian farmers down south have been met with devastating returns. With unlucky conditions, many farmers have produced significantly less then usual. It's already putting us at risk of a crisis, farmers are risking going bankrupt and food prices are expected to soar."
ww1_italy.258.t: "Labour Relations Remain Tense"
ww1_italy.258.d: "Despite our efforts, relations between workers and employers have remained in the dumster fire.

The amount of strikes is effecting our industrial base, slowing down our already pitiful industrial output."

We seek control over Dalmatia, a fully slavic territory, while Italy has ambitions elsewhere. Maybe a compromise can be reached?"
ww1_iw_br_italy.54.a: "Let's offer them a trade"
ww1_iw_br_italy.53.d: "Our 'friends' in France have refused to back us in upcoming talks with Serbia, stating it's not their problem and they don't wish to take a side. It's unfortunate, and will likely make getting everything we want out of Serbia much harder."

Today, Italy, backed by France, has approached our government pressuring us into signing a heavily Italian favored treaty.

ww1_iw_br_italy.26.t: "The Situation on the Adriatic Coast"
ww1_iw_br_italy.26.d: "Our occupation of lands on the adriatic coast was always more of a dejure thing then a defacto one, and a rogue Italian nationalist seizing Fiume from us effortlessly proves just how uncommitted we were to this occupation in reality. With the fall of Fiume, our occupation is now quite useless. Thus, we may as well offically leave the adraitic coast."

ww1_iw_br_italy.27.d: "Following D'Annunzio's occupation of Fiume, the British have decided to abandon their territories in the adriatic all together. They've thus transfered their occupied territories to us, because of the fact that their occupied lands were promisesd to us after the war anyways."

Cadorna has long complained about the domestic policy of Italian prime ministers during the war, claiming Italy has been much too soft on socialists, strikers, and pacifists."

The PSI is now working with labour unions across the country to attempt to bring our industry to a stop, which would cripple our war effort. Although they claim it's in the name of pacifism, their actions will do nothing but ensure Italy loses the war - and maybe it's freedom with it."

It comes as the Balkan crusade against the Ottoman Empire has increased nationalist sentiment everywhere. While we have been forced to stay silent because of our alliance with Austria, it's quitely legitimizing our claims we have on Austrian lands."

With a lack of government funds, Romania is looking towards the private sector to help fund development and exploration of their lands. Investments will be costly, but if there really is oil, we will certainly get some of the payout."
ww1_italy.245.a: "We're in"
ww1_italy.245.b: "Good luck to them!"
ww1_italy.165.d: "As Serbian boots march into the crumbling Ottoman Empire, a worrying development is occuring. Serbia has occupied much of the adriatic coast, which has led to a number of concerns from us. For one, Serbia annexing land on the adriatic coast would significantly strengthen it, meaning the stability of the Balkans may be threatened, leading to indirect consequences for us. In addition, it's no secret that we have our own ambitions for the Adriatic coast, including the regions Serbia occupies. Instead, we wish for these regions to be given to Albania, which will eventually be turned into an Italian protectorate. For these reasons, we have no choice but to send a warning to Serbia that them annexing lands on the Adriatic coast will not be something we can accept."
ww1_italy.165.a: "Send them the warning"
ww1_italy.166.t: "Italy Intends to Stop Our Annexation of Any Land on the Adriatic Coast"
ww1_italy.166.d: "Our ambassador in Rome has informed us that the annexation of land on the Adriatic Coast is something the Italians 'will not be able to accept'. They claim it threatens general stability in the Balkans, but its clear their real motives. Anyone can see they intend to grant the land to Albania, and then make Albania their personal puppet. While we couldn't win a war with Italy on our own, its possible Russian intervention may be able to force Italy to stand down. Either way, we'll see what happens in the peace deal with the Ottoman Empire."
ww1_italy.166.a: "Whatever"
ww1_italy.187.t: "France Welcomes Improved Relations"
ww1_italy.187.d: "While we signed no treaties, France seemed pretty clearly receptive at our attempts to improve relations. This will definitely make our 2 countries less likely to end up at war, although nothing is guaranteed yet. Either way, we can call our mission a success."
ww1_italy.393.t: "False Rumors of Inevitable Peace Deal"
ww1_italy.393.d: "Rumors no doubt being spread by anti war socialist agitators have caught fire across Italy. They claim a peace treaty with the enemy is coming soon, which will pull Italy out of the war. These negotations are of course not happening, but these rumors have given Italians lots of hope that we will exit the war and their suffering will be alievated, and as no treaty is currently being negotationed, dissapointment and anger is growing."
ww1_italy.394.t: "Peasant Riots"
ww1_italy.394.d: "As peasants watch members of the upper class spend money like there's no war at all, anger at the war and anger at the higher ups is growing. Peasants have began striking and rioting, demanding strict price controls on food as well as higher wages. With budgets already tight, we're in no position to give into their demands."

ww1_italy.187.a: "Good relations with France are benefical to Italy"
ww1_italy.188.t: "Negotiating from a Position of Strength"
ww1_italy.188.d: "As our telegram arrives to London, the French have to mantain a presence of hundreds of thousands of troops on our border, troops that they would obviously prefer to have up north. Just neutrality alone makes the Entente forces up north much weaker then they could be, let alone the disaster that could unfold if we ended up joining the German side. Thus, we inherently are starting off these negotiations from a position of strength."

ww1_italy.193.t: "Britain and France Refuse Naval Treaty"
ww1_italy.193.d: "Stating they can't make such commitments, the French and British have refused our demand for a naval treaty. This has plummeted trust in them and has lead to many in our government to want to abandon talks, although we may be able to overlook this if they accept our other demands"

ww1_italy.191.d: "We've recieved a demand from the Italians: if they are to join the Entente, they expect us to share much of our naval technology and doctrine. It would be quite a low cost to us as we could avoid giving them anything that could make them truly rival us, but if they're asking us for this we must consider if they're truly as strong as they claim they are."

ww1_italy.200.t: "Italy Requests Our Spare Army Equipment"
ww1_italy.200.d: "Our friends in Rome have informed us that they are currently dealing with army supply deficits, and that if they are to join our side and be an effective team player, they will need some of our equipment. Depending on our current equipment situation we can consider accepting or denying the request, although we must consider how much of a dead weight Italy may end up being at this rate."

ww1_italy.431.d: "We expected more pushback from the Austrians when we presented our claims in the Balkans, yet Austria conceded to all of our demands. Of course, the most controversial issue is to be brought up now: we simply cannot accept the current borders with Austria as it stands right now. We need them to cede Tyrol and Triest to us."

ww1_italy.430.t: "Extremely Ambitious Italian Claims in the Balkans"
ww1_italy.430.d: "Italy has presented to us and Germany their very large claims in the Balkans. They seek the creation of an Albanian State under their influence, which will take the entire Albanian coastline as well as Kosovo from Serbia. As we expected a protectorate containing all of Serbia and even an Albanian protectorate of our own, giving up all this land would be a hard pill to swallow. Yet, some fear we'd lose the war without Italy, and it's not like they're coming for our core territories... yet."
ww1_italy.430.a: "Well... I guess less expansion in the Balkans by us may be better for our stability anyways..."

ww1_italy.328.d: "Rinaldo Rigola, founder of the CGdL, walked down the streets of his hometown Biella, pondering. He pondered all that he had accomplished in his life. Starting off as a labourer, he slowly built up his beliefs concerning his rights and the rights of the men who toiled alongside him. Eventually though one realizes that change will never come unless it is acted upon, so Rigola became a deputy for the PSI, a post he only recently left to focus on the union. He was still relatively young for a politician, being in his late 40s. Metalworkers usually start losing steam around that age, Rigola counted his lucky stars that he was able to escape such a fate while continuing to represent and fight for the proletariat of Italy. The union, however, was losing steam. What can one do though when the need for the soldier grows evermore than the need for the labourer? The current regime seems hellbent on driving the nation to a war, and as he walked Rigola sighed at the thought of it. There is no glory to be found in war, only ditches filled with men who will never see home. A soldier's uniform will never hold you nearly as tight as a mother's embrace. Rigola opened the door of the place he would stay for the night, only to be greeted by one of those uniforms."

ww1_italy.329.t: "POLICE REPORT 1350.737"
ww1_italy.329.d: "At approximately 21:27 a loud sound was heard near the home of a local union representative. A soldier on leave attempted to discover the source of the sound. Upon arriving at the house and noting the open doorway, the soldier entered and discovered a dead man on the floor next to the entrance, with a handgun sitting by him. The soldier then elicited the help of policemen nearby, who arrived at 21:57 accompanied by a doctor.\n\nUpon arriving at the crime scene one of the police officers recognized the dead body as Secretary General of the General Confederation of Labour,  Rinaldo Rigola. The doctor determined that the wound was self-inflicted, thus being a suicide. The body was then taken to the morgue and notice was given to the owner of the residence."

ww1_red_italy.99.d: "While we've tolerated organizations such as the syndicalist union, these organizations are ultimately likely to do more harm then good. Many members of other parties such as the syndicalist union are decent people, and can be welcomed into the PSI, but we cannot tolerate a seperate political party. Although the PSI can be a diverse party, it must be the only one."
ww1_red_italy.99.a: "Only the PSI can represent the people!"
ww1_italy.232.d: "A series of shocking atrocities have been uncovered in Sciara Sciat, Libya. Around 500 Italian soldiers were captured in a failed attempt to capture the town a few weeks ago, and with the town now falling into our hands we've uncovered their fate. Instead of being taken prisoner, they were brutually murdered. Their corpses were found nailed to trees with their eyes and genitals mutilated. The story has caught fire in Italy, stirring up anger towards the Ottomans and increasing support for the war"

ww1_italy.231.t: "Massacres of Arabs in Tripoli"
ww1_italy.231.d: "Our conquest of Tripoli has been met with fierce resistance by local Arabs who see us as even worse then their previous Ottoman rulers. Protests and riots have been springing up in Tripoli, and they've been met with brutal force by occupying Italian troops. Outright massacres of Arab rebels, and, in limited cases, regular civilians have been reported, as we attempt stamp out resistance. Although not an international incident, reports of these massacres are starting to sour other countries opinions of us."
ww1_italy.231.a: "They are provoking our troops!"
ww1_italy.226.t: "Italy Requests Tunisia"
ww1_italy.226.d: "Italy has long held a grudge over our conquest of Tunisia, with them having intentions to take it over before we did. Now, they're requesting we transfer Tunisia to them as part of a deal to join the Entente. Tunisia is not the most profitable colony, but its a big sign of our prestiege. It may be preferable to cede Tunisia to Italy rather then cede Paris to Germany however, though the need for Italy will depend on how the war is going for us currently."

ww1_italy.203.d: "Italy is now pushing for us to cede them additional land in Austria, aiming for a small part of Slovenia as well as the port of Fiume to be recognized as theirs after the war. Unlike their demands for Tyrol and Istria, this has been met with some push back from the rest of the Entente.

ww1_italy.197.t: "Italy Demands Lower Tariff Barriers"
ww1_italy.197.d: "We traditionally mantain a moderate sized tariff rate on all non colonial subject nations to encourage inter-empire trade, and it seems the Italians have an issue with it. They are demanding we reduce the tariff rate between us and them by up to 10%. It would certainly disrupt our economy, but to be fair a German victory would disrupt it more. So, is it worth it?"

ww1_italy.188.a: "They should be bending over backwards to give into all of our demands!"
ww1_italy.185.t: "Cooling Relations with France"
ww1_italy.185.d: "While not outright hostile, our relations with Paris can't possible be considered good. Ressentments over Tunisa, naval competition, and being a member of the Triple Alliance have all greatly strained our relations with the French. With tensions in the world rising, many in our army and navy, to put it bluntly, do not believe we and the Triple Alliance stand much of a chance in a war with France. Instead of tying ourself entirely to Germany and Austria, proposals have been made to work towards cooling relations with France to ensure that if Germany started a war with France we would be able abandon the Triple Alliance and mantain neutrality."
ww1_italy.185.a: "That makes sense"
ww1_italy.185.b: "No point, our allies are in Berlin and we are committed to them."
ww1_italy.186.t: "Consolatory Tone from Rome"
ww1_italy.186.d: "Our neighbor to the south west certainly cannot be described as a friend. Naval races and colonial disbutes have left Italy and France quite unfriendly, but it seems Rome wishes to smooth things over. Ambassadors from Italy have arrived in Paris for a mission to improve our relations and work towards mutual understanding of our two interests. No formal treaty, but the gesture makes it clear that Italy may be intending to abandon Germany in due time."

ww1_italy.336.t: "The Return of Sidney Sonnino"
ww1_italy.336.d: "Italy's divided parliament has struggled for hours to come to a consensus for a new prime minister. Salandra was seen as a tad bit too conservative for a faction of more progressive liberals, although these liberals also opposed the nomination of any leftist prime minister as well. Briefly, the return of Luzzatti was considered, but with the political situation far from being in his favor, he declined to take the position. Eventually, the return of Sonnino was seen as acceptable by both the conservatives and left liberals, with him now forming a new government."
ww1_italy.336.a: "Let's get to work"
ww1_italy.303.t: "Italian Republican Party Endorses Intervention"
ww1_italy.303.d: "Italy's Republican party lead by Colajanni has launched a press campaign lobbying for intervention on the side of France. The Republicans have defended nationalism for their justification for war with the Central Powers, claiming Italy has a duty to liberate Italians in Tyrol and Triest. Although the PSI and the Republican Party have had close relations in the past, their differing stances on the Great War have caused tensions to rise significantly between the two."
ww1_italy.303.a: "Quite suprising from an estremo party"
ww1_italy.296.d: "Across Italy, riots by nationalists have began to break out, worrying many in the government. They demand war, either with Austria or France, as soon as possible. Their protests have been met with socialist counter protesters, with street fighting happening as a result in rare instances."

ww1_italy.296.t: "Nationalist Riots"
ww1_italy.129.t: "Just what was Needed"
ww1_italy.129.d: "With recent tariff increases crippling southern communities, the recent fiscal injection into the south and it's farmers have turned out to be just what we needed. Of course it's not solving the massive wealth gap overnight, but it's having a noticably positive impact down south. Tensions between the north and the south are starting to cool as a result."

ww1_italy.294.t: "Concerns in the Government Over War With the Ottoman Empire"
ww1_italy.294.d: "Support for war with the Ottoman Empire is wide spread across the journalist and intellectual sphere in Italy, but the idea is viewed less favorably in the government. While we have began planning for the war, many don't think it will be such the cake walk the media is making it out to be. To quote Giolitti, "The Nationalists imagine that Tripoli is the territory of a poor black simpleton whom a European state can dethrone as he wishes. But Tripoli is a province of the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire is a great European power.""
ww1_italy.294.a: "Alas, we will still prevail."
ww1_italy.291.d: "The Italian entry into the war may seem scary, but the truth is Italy is quite the paper tiger. A fairly weak army combined with an awful political situation makes them very vulernable, and one grand offensive could kick in the Italian empire and crumble it. Thus, the Italian front should be a top priority for us. A few decisive blows could see Italy knocked out of the war, allowing us to prioritize other objectives."
ww1_italy.291.a: "The Italians will be dealt with shortly."
ww1_italy.295.t: "Austria Launches a Massive Offensive"
ww1_italy.295.d: "Our generals are reporting a huge spike in Austrian troop activity on the front. It's clear as day that Austria seems to be launching some sort of massive offensive against us, throwing everything they can on the front. We must survive this onslaught, and can possible think about a counterattack of our own if the Austrians wear themself out."
ww1_italy.316.t: "Fall of Rhodes"
ww1_italy.316.d: "Our attempts to expand the war outside of Libya are going well as we've captured the island of Rhode. It's garnered some Russian and Austrian outrage, but their anger hasn't resulted in any serious consequences. Rhodes serves as an important naval base, and can be used to continue attacks in the Ottoman Empire proper as the war goes on."
ww1_italy.316.a: "Great!"
ww1_italy.293.t: "Austrian Navy Shells Venice"
ww1_italy.293.d: "The Austrian navy has recently completed a mass bombardment of Venice. While our coastal batteries attempted to fight the Austrians off, they weren't enough. A lack of communication devices prevented the Italian navy from being able to properly respond, as once the navy realized what Austria was attempting, it was too late to get the information to our naval commanders."
ww1_italy.293.a: "A critical oversight!"
ww1_italy.292.t: "Austrians raid Italian shipments"
ww1_italy.292.d: "The Austrian navy has began a raiding campaign on ships importing goods into Italy. Whilst trying their best, our navy is struggling to stop the Austrians from sinking our ships. This reduction in imports is leading to higher food prices which turns into food shortages in some areas and it's harming our war production, which relies on some foreign imported resources to fuel the machines in our factories."
ww1_italy.292.a: "How horrible of them!"
ww1_italy.436.t: "Talks With Italy Fall Apart"
ww1_italy.436.d: "Despite being productive at first, negotations to get Italy into the Central Powers have fallen apart. Disputes between represenatives Sonnino and Berchtold over the fate of highly contested territories could not be settled, and thus Italy walked out of negotiations. We can only hope they stay neutral."
ww1_italy.436.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.437.t: "Talks With Italy End Successfully"
ww1_italy.437.d: "Despite facing several tense moments, talks between Austria, Italy, and Germany have ended with a consensus amongst all negotating partners being reached. If everything goes smoothly, Italy should be entering the war on our side soon."
ww1_italy.437.a: "We await their entrance then."
ww1_italy.183.t: "Naval Officers Lobby for more Funding"
ww1_italy.183.d: "Presenting us with a variety of graphs and charts, commanders, admirals and veterans of the Regia Marina are currently lobbying us to increase their funding. We've resisted expanding the naval budget so far, but their lobbying campaigns are increasingly worrying many in the political sphere of Italy, with the increased pressure on our government to do something."
ww1_italy.183.a: "Patience is a virtue..."
ww1_italy.244.t: "Suffrage Riots"
ww1_italy.244.d: "Riots across Italy - both north and south - have broken out with workers and farmers alike demanding more representation in Italian politics. Right now, voting rights are very limited, leading to most Italians being apathetic to politics historically. As of recent, it seems that Italians see the status quo as unacceptable and are no longer accepting the current system. The riots have put pressure on both Giolitti and PM's in parliament to take action."
ww1_italy.244.a: "We must adress their concerns"
ww1_italy.265.t: "Fall of Aziziya"
ww1_italy.265.d: "Our troops have completely destroyed the Ottoman force in the town of Aziziya, with our forces now having control over the city. The battle was marked by the significant presence of irregular warfair, with both Ottoman and Italian forces not having any clear 'front line' near the town, instead being a savage fight between disorganized Italian troops and ambushing Natives and Ottoman troops. The mess aside, the town is now ours, and our march down south can continue."
ww1_italy.265.a: "What a win!"
ww1_italy.266.t: "Port of Hums Secured"
ww1_italy.266.d: "Our assualt on the naval port of Hums has ended in a Italian victory, with a rather brutal slog resulting in the small Ottoman force being overrun, with the Ottoman army retreating in all directions. The fall of Hum is a logistical victory, being one of 3 major ports on the west side of Libya. Our supply chains in Libya certainly aren't ideal, and hopefully the fall of Hums will allow us to bring in more supplies."
ww1_italy.266.a: "A key stragetic victory!"
ww1_italy.267.t: "Misrata Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.267.d: "The attack on Misrata has secured a decisive win against the Ottoman Empire, with our troops rapidly advancing in the town center and overwhelming the disorganized Ottoman garrison. With the fall of Misrata, our struggling supply chain in Libya should be relieved. The port will allow us to bring in more supplies to our army, as our advance into Libya continues."
ww1_italy.267.a: "Excellent!"
ww1_italy.268.t: "Fall of Sokna"
ww1_italy.268.d: "As our troops sweep through the brutal deserts of southern Libya, our forces have secured Sokna, one of the only notably large oasis towns in the hot sahara desert. Our forces met a combination of demoralized Ottoman troops and a large amount of resistance from the local tribesmen. We've pushed out the Ottoman force from the town, and control over it is somewhat secure although there is a high level of civilian resistance."
ww1_italy.268.a: "This war is coming to a close!"
ww1_italy.269.t: "Gheddabia Captured from the Ottomans"
ww1_italy.269.d: "Our forces are rapidly advancing in Eastern Libya as the Libyan town of Gheddabia has fallen to us. The town is home to key supplies, which will allow us to keep our army afloat as it advances into the desert that surrounds the town on all sides."
ww1_italy.269.a: "We have them on the run!"
ww1_italy.270.t: "Fall of Bengasi"
ww1_italy.270.d: "A combination of naval bombardments and our assualting infantry have driven the entrenched Ottoman garrison in Bengasi out of the city. This key naval port is home to one of the largest cities in the Tripolitanian region, with its fall marking a significant blow to the Ottoman control over the region. With Bengasi gone, it's likely going to be very hard for the Ottomans to supply their forces in Libya going foward."
ww1_italy.270.a: "Great job, boys, this one's gonna hurt them"
ww1_italy.271.t: "Fall of Derna"
ww1_italy.271.d: "Our troops have captured Derna from the Ottoman Libya, as our advances its Eastern region continue. Fighting in Derna was suprisingly professional, compared to the disorganized chaos seen in much of western Libya. Our forces conquered an inferior, though pretty organized Ottoman defense that was garrisoning this coastal town. Reports say that the Ottoman troops have fled down south in a disorganized retreat; which we should capitalize on."
ww1_italy.271.a: "A decisive victory from our army!"
ww1_italy.272.t: "Victory in Tobruk"
ww1_italy.272.d: "Our army has scored a victory over the Ottomans in the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya. Although initial intelligence suggested a rather small Ottoman presence in the city, the city turned out to have more defenders then thought. Despite this, our troops were successfully able to establish a stranglehold over the Ottoman supply lines to the cities, significantly weakning the Ottoman forces in the city and allowing for a successful but more bloody then expected assault."
ww1_italy.272.a: "We wiped out a large amount of their forces!"
ww1_italy.283.t: "Italian Ships Bombard Beirut"
ww1_italy.283.d: "Early this morning, Italian ships arrived off the coast of Beirut, and tensions between them and our local forces began rising. Eventually, after a long standoff, the Italian ships started bombarding the town. The bombardment caused widespread destruction as ships anchored in the harbour were sunk, buildings throughout the city were damaged, and numerous civilian casualties happened in the chaos."
ww1_italy.283.a: "We will get our revenge!"
ww1_italy.284.t: "Fighting on the Western front Disrupts Coal Deliveries"
ww1_italy.284.d: "Large coals imports that usually travel through French railways have been destroyed by Germany artillery, wrecking our imports. Energy prices are starting to rise as import costs increase with our attempts to redirect our supply lines away from French railways. "
ww1_italy.284.a: "This war needs to hurry up and end!"
ww1_italy.285.t: "German Submarines raid the British Channel"
ww1_italy.285.d: "Our imports from the United Kingdom are seeing huge delays as British shipping attempts to dodge German submarines sinking anything leaving the mainland. Supply chains are starting to back up due to delays, and prices are rising."
ww1_italy.285.a: "Why can't Germany just make exceptions?"

Maximalists have already began splitting off from the PSI and declaring the formation of their own party, although it hasn't seen much success. With the PSI remaining reformist, it open the opprotunity to Giolitti to secure a electoral alliance containing them, as he generally prefers them to the catholic block."

ww1_italy.74.d: "A large number of socialists have been kicked out of the PSI for their support of Giolitti and parliamentry procedures after the disaster in Libya. These socialists, claim the maximalists who have been leading the clense of the party, are revisionists who betrayed the workers of Italy by supporting their liberal oppressors. These expulsions have seen a dramatic increase in power by the maximalists, who have seen their pro revolution rhetoric earn them more support amongst the Italian public."
ww1_italy.75.t: "ANI Party Grow Significantly"
ww1_italy.75.d: "The originally small ANI has seen its members and strength skyrocket as the party has been running a highly successful anti liberal campaign, claiming under their leadership the Libyan disaster would never have happened. Their extreme nationalism as well as anti corruption rhetoric has made their message appear very inspiring to the Italian people - a people tired of the constant loses and embarassment on the world stage that the Kingdom of Italy has faced in it's recent history. They're seeing their movement go from a small, niche movement to rapidly becoming one of the largest organized parties in Europe. With this, it's expected they will capture a fair share of Italy's parliament seats come the next election - at least at the current rate of their growth."

ww1_italy.71.d: "There's no other way to spin it: what happened in Libya was a disaster, probably the greatest disaster in the young kingdoms entire history. What was promised to be a cake walk ended up becoming a humiliating slog that ended in Italy's loss. Thousands have been lost in a war that was managed utterly disastrously by Giolitti.\n\nBoth socialists and nationalists have their own explanation for what went wrong. The socialists are claiming, despite many of them initially  being supportive of the war, that they knew the conflict was always a bad idea - an imperialist adventure over a piece of sand that would have brought no benefit to the common Italian people. The war, they are claiming, was brought on to Giolitti by the interests of big business who intend to use the colony and it's people as a tool to exploit to enrich themselves.\n\nThe nationalists claim the war was completely winnable, if the weak liberal leadership of Giolitti was run by someone stronger, someone who truly loved Italy and wasn't held back by degenerate and liberal values, as well as someone who didn't give into the demanmds of Europes other great powers. Demands that hindered Italy's ability to wage the war.\n\nWith such a resounding defeat after patriotic emotions being so high, many Italians can't help but to be swayed by one of these explanations. Both nationalists and socialists have seen their support begin to skyrocket lately."

Although some socialists are outraged, others understand [ITA.GetLeader] practicalism."

ww1_italy.72.d: "The PSI can't help but to remind the Italian people: we warned you the war was not a good idea. For months, much of the PSI waged a anti war campaign, warning the conflict would result in thousands of Italians losing their lives for no benefit to the people. And they were more right then they ever could have predicted. With loses in the thousands, the only thing Italy has to show for it is war reparations to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Many Italians have found themselves swayed by the PSI rhetoric - they were right here, the war was a complete disaster. Maybe they're right about the need for dramatic economic reforms across the country too?"

ww1_italy.73.d: "The Risorgimento was supposed to lead to a new golden age for Italy, one where it would be respected abroad and cement itself as a great player in European politics. What's the actual results? Losing 2 wars to nations in which we had significant advantaged over. Twice, liberals have completely blown it when it mattered most. Because of liberals lack of love for Italy, it's refusal to escalate wars in fear of the great powers of Europe, and the corruption of liberal governments, Italy has been completely humiliated on the world stage twice in a row. Only through strong leadership, anti corruption, and nationalism can Italy hope to fufill the ideas of the Risorgimento."

ww1_italy.54.d: "Our navy has clashed with the Ottoman navy in the Central Mediterranean Sea near the port of Preveza, in Greece. It seems this has caused quite the international reaction, as we're recieving demands from Austria, Russia, and Greece to limit our naval activities in the Balkans and to ensure the war does not spread into a regional conflict. This has outraged the nationalists, who are calling on Italy to reject the international pressure and do whatever operations in the war it pleases."

He'd plan to propose it soon, but there was a real force of opposition on the right. He knew what to do, though. Giolitti got out his files that he had on every member of parliament. For every single member of parliament, Giolitti kept a small file about them: their weaknesses. Giolitti has always been a master at manipulation, and he often credited it to these files. He looked through the opposition, one by one he started formulating a plan to manipulate key PM's into falling into line. He wasn't worried anymore. He'd get it done."

The problem, however, is a radical wing in the PSI, the 'Maximalists', have grown greatly in popularity lately. There are leadership elections coming up in the PSI in just a few years, and there's a real risk that the Maximalists take over the party. The Maximalists decry cooperation with our government, and them being elected would surely lead to them withdrawing all support from our government. We of course don't rely on socialist support, but their Withdrawal from the coalition would force us to look towards other options, and cause us a headache to say the least."

Although not exactly an unexpected move, some abroad were hoping we would take a more moderate approach and establish a protectorate system similar to the British in Egypt. The move has certainly brought delight to the Nationalist minority, who had been pushing for this since the 1800's."

ww1_italy.233.d: "Our knowledge of Libyas terrian is very surface level, and it's become a bigger problem then expected. Currently, our military have no maps of Libya, meaning we have little knowledge of the terrain and geography of the regions we are advancing in. Ottoman troops have been using this to their advantage, giving them a strong leg up in combat."
ww1_italy.233.a: "Whatever. It's not enough to save them"
ww1_italy.40.d: "Our troops and even Giolitti himself were under the, in hindsight rather naive, assumption that Italian troops would be welcomed with parades and gifts of home cooked meals by the locals of Libya who were desperately waiting for Italian troops to liberate them. This has turned out to be completely wrong however, as Libyan locals are just as resistant to Italian liberation as they are to Ottoman oppression. We've seen little to no local cooperation against the Ottoman Empire in Libya. If anything, the locals seem to prefer the Turks to us."

ww1_italy.35.d: "There's been a dramatic increase in strikes up north which is slowing down our industry. It comes as the socialist party drifts further and further towards revolutionary rhetoric as it intends to bring change through force instead of through the democratic system. These strike increases are leading to northern business owners calling on us to intervene, and favor employers in strike negotiations."

ww1_italy.36.t: "'No Justice, No Peace' vs 'a Revolution From the Ballot Box'"
ww1_italy.36.d: "There's been a debate amongst socialist circles lately on just how reformable Italian democracy is. There's an increasing sentiment of refusing to make peace with a system seen as unfixable. With Italy's current electoral system, only a fraction of Italians - generally more well off then the average Italian - are the ones who vote. How are socialists supposed to win in this rigged system?\n\nOn the other side, however, the more moderate reformists in the PSI still believe democracy is far from irredeemable. It has its issues, yes, but the sort of violent and anti democratic rhetoric from the maximalists is far from the solution. They instead coin the idea of a 'revolution from the ballot box' in which Italians will eventually wake up from the oppressions of capitalism and give them at least a major say in the make up of Italy's parliament, in which they will pass suffrage reform and thus secure an electoral mandate for years to come."

ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists in recent years. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims that the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. Some nationalists have indeed been calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of nationalist seperatists, unstable politics, and a neglected army. These texts are increasingly swaying Italians towards the idea of a war with the Ottoman Empire - an idea that was struggling to break out of fringe nationalist circles but is now increasingly gaining support."

ww1_italy.243.d: "The Mafia has had a close relationship with Italian politicians for decades, and Giolitti is no different. They've had their fair share of interactions in the past, and with the rapidly changing political situation they've offered us a deal. In exchange for us giving them some... lenience in their activities down south, they will suppress maximalist socialists down south through their... own means."

Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary, as such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Besides, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. Why waste political capital to oppose something that will probably never happen?"
ww1_italy.23.a: "Nothing Ever Happens."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to have our interests at heart. Austria is actively oppressing Italians in its borders, and the French have shown no respect for our legitimate claims in Africa and elsewhere. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Italy needs to grow stronger, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."

With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, has begun denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression, a war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of a minority group being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialists to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to create a rift amongst socialists in Italy."

In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming that the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with Europe's sick man.

They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia.

ww1_italy.162.a: "They fear the power of Italy!"
ITA_no_they_do_not: "They do not, infact, fear the 'power' of Italy."
ww1_italy.158.d: "The ambassador from Vienna has offered Rome to drop any objections to Italian interests in Albania to ease our fears about their occupation of Serbia. This means we will be able to occupy Albania with no objections from the central powers at all. It's definitely a win for Italy, but this doesn't satisify all of our demands. If Austria isn't willing to offer more in future talks, this might mean nothing."
ww1_italy.158.a: "We'll take it!"
ww1_italy.159.t: "Vienna Offers Nothing"
ww1_italy.159.d: "Completely ignoring our request for compensation, Austria has claimed their occupation of Serbia is completely temporary and that they do not threaten any of our interests. There's no other way to spin this: it's a spit in the face to Italy. This doesn't mean there's no future for Italy in the central powers, but if Austria doesn't tone down its ego we may indeed have to take our business to London..."
ww1_italy.159.a: "Whatever!"
ww1_italy.156.d: "The Prime Minister has delivered a speech today on Italy's general plan for it's foreign policy: Sacred Egoism. Italy will enter negotiations with both Germany and Britain, and whatever side can satisfy its interests will be the side Italy will join. Parliament has voted in a landslide to record its approval of the new policy, and thus negotiations can begin."
ww1_italy.156.a: "Let's see where this takes us"
ww1_italy.153.d: "The great powers of the world are generally agreed to be Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Austria, and America. While the Risorgimento promised that Italy would have its place on the world stage, we're currently more in the rank of secondary powers like the Ottomans and Spain. We have a dream to change that, however. A mass expansion of the army and then joining either the Entente or the Central Powers, winning a great war and claiming our rightful lands in the Balkans as well as from either France or Austria, and finally solidifying Italy as the next great power. It's ambitious, but the idea is quite alluring to many Italians in parliament."
ww1_italy.153.a: "So they will support more military funding? Perfect"
ww1_italy.15.d: "Luzzatti's government fell apart because he did not base political support from any faction in Italy's parliament, but Giolitti is no novice to Italian politics. Already serving 3 terms as prime minister, he knows how to carefully and strategically align and isolate political factions whenever needed. With his 4th mandate secured, he'll need to keep enough support from MP's in Italy's parliament to ensure his governments survival."

ww1_italy.14.d: "Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. With Luzzatti's weak leadership failing to consolidate a base of support, Luzzatti has resigned rather then be a lame duck. Who will run the next government? Giolitii of course. It was always going to be Giolitii. No other Italian politician has nearly as much influence and support as him. With him easily securing the Prime Minister slot, time will tell how his 4th cabinet ends up."

ww1_italy.13.t: "Breakneck Industrialization"
ww1_italy.13.d: "It is no secret that our status as a great power lies with the north, not the south. The duchies and republics that made Northern Italy their home were able to consolidate and advance to greater heights because of the relative peace. The predecessor to our nation, Sardinia-Piedmont, is such an example.\n\nThe south has, in contrast, laid in a state of disrepair for over a thousand years, exploited by the Arabs, the French, and the Spaniards. It is a shame to say that our current policies do much of the same.\n\nAll these pieces of history have shaped the way Italy is today: from the top down. The problem is, the wealth never trickles down, it only flows to the north. It is a price we must bear as a nation, yet only one part does so. Our industrial might shall remain concentrated in Turin, Milan, and the Venetian countryside for as long as this remains. It does not look like it will change anytime soon, but that is just another sad story in the annals of the history of our peninsula."

If we can successfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing successfully. It won't be easy, however.

The centrists want Giolitti back, the catholics want a new conservative prime minister, the socialists were never never going to support us, and neither were the far right. With pretty much every faction of the government wanting us gone, it's basically inevitable the government will be pushed out soon, unless we resign before then."

ww1_italy.1.t: "Giolitti's Support"
ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Luzzatti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."
ww1_italy.1.a: "We'll need to perfect the balancing act"
ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. Most of the PSI's power base comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely that around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to all of their demands. Still, it's not as if our overtures to the PSI have been completely useless, as we've been able to secure a small base of support from their party for our upcoming agenda."
ww1_italy.2.a: "The radicals are putting politics over the people!"
ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysts are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country, catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists see him as weak at best, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a collapse, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a collapsing, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."

ww1_italy.10.d: "Italian nationalists have long wanted to build a colonial empire, however Italy proved to be too weak to secure its deserved chunk of Africa. The press, however, has began pushing for a war with the Ottomans to secure Libya, with an earnest response from their readers. They claim Libya is full of natural resources and a population pleading for Italian liberation, being defended by a measly 4 thousand soldiers. Word of mouth proves quite capable too, with whispers being exchanged in parliament about how capturing Libya would be a walk in the park. It would be quite the treat if those whispers proved true, but you can never know until you try."

ww1_italy.315.d: "Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Italy have began to break down lately, with Austrian mediations all failing. Nationalists have hijacked the media to rally the public behind a war, and some sort of confrontation with Turkey seems inevitable. The situation does not excite Prime Minister Giolitti at all, however. In his private speeches with parliament and military seniors, he's described his fears. As he put it himself, "The integrity of what remains of the Ottoman Empire is one of the principles upon which the world's balance of power is based. Therefore, I reject the idea that it is in our national interest to shatter one of the cornerstones of the international order. What if, after we have attacked Libya and destabilized the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans begin to stir? And what if a Balkan war provokes a clash between the two power blocs and a European war? Italy must not be the country that bears the responsibility of putting a match to the powder keg.""

The both also understand working with eachother can have mutual benefits for themselves and the country. However, Giolitti's recent policies of municipal socialism has lead to great anger amongst them. These policies are cutting deeply into their profits and causing business growth to slow down.

In exchange for recognizing Ottoman suzerainty over Libya, they will simply hand us control over Libya. Recognizing  Ottoman suzerainty over Libya would change pretty much nothing. We'd control the territory, the resources, the laws, everything. Our soldiers would garison it. It would simply be ours in every defacto way.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this war is not just for Libya, its to rally Italy's political sphere to support Giolitti. Nationalists are increasingly becoming an influencial faction, and a war would easily gain their support. In addition, a war would surely have a rally around the flag effect and would allow Giolitti support of pretty much everyone, even for a temporary time."

It seems a liberal-catholic alliance is not crazy at all, at least not as crazy as you would think it to be 10 years ago, as alliances between catholics and liberals have been popping up in at the local level in Turin, Florence, and Venice.

However, it seems Turati has calculated that cooperation with Giolitti is becoming less and less politically viable. With extremist maximalists becoming a greater force in the Italian political sphere, calculating working with Giolitti only serves to anger them, and fracture the party, Turati has been less and less open to working with Giolitti.

Indeed, Giolitti did take the opposite stance on the issue then the one he has been parading as of late, however Giolitti has presented his own argument to them on why Italy is ready for the expansion of the electorate. He's argued that Italy is much more educated and has much higher literacy rates then it did just 20 years ago, with education helping to build a 'regime of liberty'. Giolitti has, depending on who you ask, either boldly, or delusionally, claimed that Italy's working class will not be swayed by 'lunatics'. He argued that the general masses are smarter than given credit for, and that, as labour conditions improve through labour action, socialism will gradually decline in Italy. He certainly isn't swaying any conservatives with his arguments, but some of the old guard liberals are starting to come around."

ww1_italy.33.d: "Since Italy's founding, Catholics have been ordered by the pope to not participate in government in any form, including not voting in elections. While not followed by every catholic, it has definitely hindered Italy's ability to create a functioning liberal democracy. Despite catholics normally being an opponent to Giolitti, their participation in politics is a key goal for Giolitti. For one, they're far less emotional then the socialists. Working with them has, historically, been much easier. In addition, catholic participation in democracy is needed to give it legitimacy, which will strengthen it from any future authoritarian king or bad actor. Thus, while catholics are a political enemy for now, it's crucial for Giolitti that they still participate in politics. Besides, who knows? Maybe we'll find them to be our newest friends."

ww1_italy.29.d: "Giolitti has always been a master of the art of trasformismo. Isolating and allying whatever factions of Italy that make sense for his current ambitions. This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with.

People are celebrating our success, the inevitable collapse of the Ottoman military, and are awaiting for us to push them completely out of Libya. In fact, our recent successes have made nationalsists so sure that we are curb stomping the Ottoman Empire, they are calling for us to expand the war. They specifically call for us to make naval landings in Albania and kick the Ottoman garrison out, which could cause mass revolts across the Turkish balkans and lead to a collapse of their empire in that region. It would deal a unrecoverable blow to Turkey and also secure us Albania.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this notion is completely infeasable. Our limited naval actions around Albania themself have caused mass protests from Greece, Russia, and Austria, who have threatened us into drawing back. Any demands of Albanian annexation would cause complete international outrage and isolation, thus we must stick to Libya."

Thus, we should be able to easily take them for ourself. It's not the prize that Albania is, but it should still help to satisfy the nationalists, and besides the island are indeed useful naval bases."

ww1_italy.179.d: "Libya is a mostly muslim territory, as opposed to the catholic Italy. Many in the Catholic Church want to work towards converting Libya to Christianity, but Giolitti has been more apprehensive to this idea. As a strong proponent of seperation between church and state, the idea of allowing the Church a free hand to do whatever they wish in Libya is worrying to him. Although, doing so would bring greater catholic support to Giolitti, which will be crucial towards mantaining his regime. "

With a polarized parliament becoming more and more resistant to trasformismo and generally disliking Giolitti's policies, his government has lost the high levels of support it needs to function. With this, Giolitti has handed his resignation to the king. It's not clear who will be Giolitti's sucessor yet, but it looks like whoever gets Giolitti's endorsement will have the best shot."

ww1_italy.262.t: "Avanti!'s Newest Writer"
ww1_italy.262.d: "Avanti, the largest socialist newspaper in Italy and offical piece of the PSI, has had a dramatic change in leadership, with Benito Mussolini being promoted to the head writer of Avanti!. The infamous socialist was a writer of a smaller marxist newspaper in Forli, where he advocated for a violent workers revolution against the state. The promotion of Mussolini is expected to push Avanti!'s publications further to the maximalist side of things. With such a large base of readers, Mussolini's writings, which are likely to advocate for violent strikes and revolutionary activities, is likely going to destabilize the Italian political situation."
ww1_italy.262.a: "He's insane!"
ww1_italy.263.t: "Il Trono e l'Altare"
ww1_italy.263.d: "Benito Mussolini's latest Avanti! publication is gaining national traction. Titled “The Throne and the Altar”, Mussolini gives a scathing criticism of both the Catholic Church and the monarchy. He claims that the Catholic Church has, for years, worked with the King in collusion to crush socialist movements. Although a lot of Avanti!'s ramblings are seen as insane by the average Italian, the striking evidence and examples Mussolini provides in his article have raised... questions. It is true that the Catholic Church has been far from apolitical in Italy's history, and the reported incidents of voter supression up North are not getting ignored by Italians."
ww1_italy.263.a: "Everyone should see this for the insane conspiracy theory it is!"
ww1_italy.264.t: "Contro il Riformismo"
ww1_italy.264.d: "The PSI has became increasingly dominated by violent radicals in recent years. Included in this takeover of the PSI is the maximalist Benito Mussolini's aquirement of Avanti!, the largest socialist newspaper in Italy. Recently, he's published a new article titled “Contro il Riformismo“, in which he writes a opinion piece against the reformist, parliamentarist, wing of the PSI. Only through a violent revolution can the workers achieve the dreams of Marx and the lives they deserve. By working inside the inherently bourgeoise dominated Italian political system, Mussolini argues that the socialists are helping to legitimize a government that should inherently be illegitimate. He claims that true democracy does not lie in Italy's sham and exclusionary parliament, but in the workers who provide the means of production.\n\nHis openly violent and anti democratic rhetoric is helping to push moderates away from the socialist party, and is radicalizing the core socialist base of industrial workers up north. While no true revolutionary attempt has been made yet, Mussolini appears openly be planning to stage one. It's clear that a tight leash on these socialists is needed."
ww1_italy.264.a: "But what can we do?"
ww1_italy.67.d: "The influencial maximalist Benito Mussolini was arrested today for leading a anti war riot. The riot was quickly broken up by police and lead to him being arrested by police and sentenced to a jail sentence of a few months. Mussolini and other socialists have been quick to denounce the arrest as unjustified. Ironically, the arrest of Mussolini has only brought more attention to the maximalists, and its lead to their popularity increasing."

ww1_italy.68.d: "2 influencial socialists, Ivanoe Bonomi and Leonida Bissolati, have been expelled from the PSI due to them supporting the Ottoman Italian war, which although proved to be popular at first has quickly became detested by socialists across the country. The maximalists in particular were the main drivers behind their expulsion, and them helping to expell Bonomi and Bissolati has increased their strength in the PSI."

The crucial Catholic vote will help significantly with ensuring that liberals and Catholics don't end up splitting their vote up north which would lead to a socialist sweep. The alliance will also help ensure that the south is delivered to Giolitti's electoral block. Although the alliance does have one dramatic drawback: Giolitti's coalition had often in the past contained northern organized labour.

The leftist union forced us to endorse numerous socialists to try and block right wingers from winning seats, causing the number of socialists in parliament to nearly double. While the socialists are on theory our friend, on paper we know our partnership is quite temporary, and it's likely they will withdraw their support from our government within a few years. Radicals also performed well, defending many seats down south and helping to block catholics from reaching a significant number of members in parliament, although they still managed to gain a few seats. Overall, and perhaps dissapointingly to Giolitti, the biggest losers this election seemed to be the center left and center right.

It's been compared to the difference between the national assembly and the national convention during the French Revolution: the members of the new Italian parliament are generally younger, less cautious, and more polarized. It's leading to many PM's across different parties to reject Giolitti's trasformismo, as many feel alienated by the constant backroom backstabbing and contradictionary deals of the last 2 years under Giolitti. In addition, there's a lot more socialists and nationalists than in the previous parliament, and despite attempting to work with both groups, they've proven to be a bit... stubborn.

Giolitti has had 3 cabinets already, and he's quite confident he can make another political comeback at a later date, thus he is considering a resignation.

ww1_italy.62.d: "The 1913 parliament election results are in, and it seems while the Liberal union held its own, it still lost seats over all. This comes as both far left and far right canidates have seen great success this election cycle, with the PSI and nationalists both expanding their seats in parliament. If this election was a referendum on Giolitti, it certainly proved the Italian people are somewhat tired of him. "

Although the king was very hesitant to allow the socialists to form a government, seeing the increased radicalization of both nationalists and socialists, denying their legitimate government would most likely cause a civil war. Thus, bregrungingly, the king has allowed the socialists to form a government. "

Italy's parliament is now deeply radical, deeply polarized, and has a deep hatred for Giolitti. With such a horrible election showing, and him now giving up his granted emergency powers, it seems Giolitti will be ousted by a vote of no confidence, or will have to resign himself, within a few weeks."

ww1_italy.60.d: "Despite being very hesitant to work with socialists, the triumph of moderate socialists over the radical maximalists has led GIolitti to believe a deal with them could be made. Thus, he reached out to Turati to form a electoral alliance between the socialists, radicals, and Giolitti's liberals. The formation of this all leftist union has outraged catholics and conservatives, who feel Giolitti may be irredeemable now. However, the electoral alliance does make Giolitti's prospects in the next election very strong. The help of organized labour up north will mean Giolitti will have a death grip over the region, basically securing a parliament majority. "

ww1_italy.51.d: "Despite showing lukewarm support for the war at first, the maximalists have quickly flip-flopped on the issue decrying the war as a massive failure of Giolitti and another reason why the PSI should refuse to work with him. Indeed, the Turkish Italian war has proven to be very unpopular amongst socialists due to it being bloodier and longer then promised. Their rallying cries have increased support for their vision in the party of no liberal cooperation, and caused some PSI MP's to flip to opposing our government."

With only Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Australia currently having women able to vote, this is historic move and might represent increased momentum for womens suffrage movements world wide.

Well, for a while, Italian production of these classic Italian goods had struggled to compete with cheaper, lesser quality foreign made versions. With our recent new tariffs, things are starting to swing back the other way. Italian specialities are increasingly taking back their rightful shelf space in grocery stores compared to their inferior foreign counterparts, and it's became quite the propaganda piece for the government.

We've entered talks with major steel companies in an attempt to find a solution, and negotiations have progressed relatively well. Although any form of workers control over their factories was rejected, they did agree that an eight hour work week is reasonable. Implementing this reform should satisify many workers, although not all of them. It will also give workers confidence that the reformist way of negotations is superior to a revolution."

ww1_iw_italy.18.d: "The decline in support for liberals across Italy has forced the currently dominant liberal block to make bold moves to try and save their position. The radical party has enjoyed positive relations with the establishment liberals in the last two cabinets, and thus the liberals and radicals have agreed to fuse into one party. Joining them is the Italian democrat party, a recently founded social democrat party that is expected to perform well in the south. With the agreement finalized, the Italian Democratic Liberal Party has been founded."

Although they do have few allies, it's still something we need to pay key attention to. We could attempt to shut down the strike, utilizing it's low favorability within socialist groups. On the otherhand, if we assess the situation is stable enough, we could let them go ahead. An attempted violent revolution would certainly give us an excuse to crackdown on the socialist movement."

This was mainly to strengthen Italy's domestic industry, and while it has protected local manufacturers in Italy, it's led to unusually expensive goods in Italian markets and a devastated south. Seeing that their tariff strategy is no longer working, they've reached out to us for talks. In response to Italy's tariffs on our goods, we've placed our own very high tariffs on Italian agricultural products, which has devastated their farmer's exports.

ww1_italy.364.d: "Although socialists have been striking and even occupying factories up north for months now, events have began to esculate dramatically. In Tornino, local anarchists seized several factories and clashed with local authorities. After a few weeks, police were given the order to reoccupy the factories seized by anarchists. The anarchists moved to arm themself and the two sides exchanged gun fire. Anarchists successfully forced the police to retreat, and a indepedent commune has been declared. This quickly spread, with cripplingly high levels of industries being seized by these so called independent communes. As we move to resecure these key industries, a civil war is inevitable."
ww1_italy.364.a: "It really came to this, huh?"
ww1_italy.363.t: "Revolutionary Socialists Grow Their Support"
ww1_italy.363.d: "The situation on the battle front aside, the home front is continuing to worsen. Inflation remains high, energy shortages continue, food shortages worsen, and Italians fail to see how winning the war that is ruining there life matters. Revolutionary leftists who have argued against the war are seeing their support grow, which worries many in the government that a revolution may be on the way."
ww1_italy.363.a: "The war will be won soon!"
ww1_red_italy.95.t: "[ITA.GetLeader] is Always Right"
ww1_red_italy.95.d: "The recent culture in the government has shifted dramatically from a vibrant party-dominated state to a state dominated by one man, [ITA.GetLeader]. With the mass firing of the opposition, the government has been completely stacked with loyalists. Propaganda has also shifted from promoting the great socialist vision to the great vision of [ITA.GetLeader]. As far as the average citizen knows, [ITA.GetLeader] is always right."
ww1_red_italy.95.a: "A truly great leader"
ww1_italy.400.t: "Bolsheviks Inspire Socialists in Italy"
ww1_italy.400.d: "As news of the bolshevik coup in Russia reaches Italy, many socialists can't help but to feel inspired. Workers in Italy have began flying the soviet flag, attempting to occupy factories near them, and began to chant the slogan “Do as in Russia”. It's severly radicalized many on the left, and their revolutionary activities are garnering them the attention they crave."
ww1_italy.400.a: "They're outright traitors to the nation!"
ww1_red_italy.103.t: "The Inalienable Rights"
ww1_red_italy.103.d: "The constitution of the monarchy had very weak protections for civil liberties, and the post civil war constituion failed to right these wrongs. With the newest series of articles to the constitution, we should hopefully not have to worry about a oppressive regime ever again. Now, the freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and the right to judical process are now enshrined in the constituion."
ww1_red_italy.103.a: "These were necessary reforms"

ww1_red_italy.22.t: "Establishment Becomes the Opposition"
ww1_red_italy.22.d: "Once the unquestioned champtions of Italy, the bourgeois have rapidly lost everything. They have now organized across Italy to try and garner support for an opposition, both passive and violent. Especially succesful in the catholic south, liberals and monarchists have began to encourage resistance to our government. Their goals are divided, some want our government overthrown while others simply want protections for what they see as a threat to their way of life."

ww1_red_italy.51.d: "Although we've seized all of Italy, the great powers of the world are refusing to recognize us. With all great powers being controlled by liberals monarchs and conservatives, the idea of a socialist and proletariat lead government is clearing scaring them. They seem to think that legitimizing our regime may increase support for socialism in their own countries."
ww1_red_italy.51.a: "They're right to fear that!"
ww1_red_italy.28.d: "Our seizure of Vatican City has not quelled the revolting southerns as we had hoped. Instead, their protests have intensified. They see us as waging a war on their faith, even though our consitution allows private practice of whatever religion they please. Either way, calabaria is in complete chaos. Southern revolters have seized much of the province, and we are struggling to mantain control over the region. Luckily, they are not daring to attempting to overthrow our government, but they do appear to be trying to carve out their own indepedent state. We must crush them."
ww1_red_italy.28.a: "Can't we catch a break?"
ww1_red_italy.23.d: "Southern Italians in Calabria are attempting to resist our rules and laws. Many rural towns in the south are refusing our new secular laws, refusing to follow our socialist system, and are clashing with local authorities attempting to enforce the new socialist laws. While it's likely to go nowhere, it still shows we have a lot of work left to do before the brainwashed people in the south accept their liberation."

ww1_red_italy.24.d: "In Cosenza, catholics and bourgeois funded protesters have clashed with police attempting to enforce our rightful and just laws. Although we tried to de escalate the situation, rioters eventually forced our hand. Several have been left dead from the event, and the news story has began to catch fire in the south."

ww1_red_italy.27.d: "The popes rhetoric has Unfortuantely given us no choice. Members of the peoples army have marched into the vatican to seize the city and place the pope under house arrest. We of course wouldn't dare to harm the pope, but having him under house arrest means he can no longer provoke insurection in the south. The current plan is to eventually ship the pope somewhere further away from Italy."
ww1_red_italy.27.a: "A long time coming honestly!"
ww1_red_italy.25.d: "Responding to news of the massacare in Cosenza, southern Italians have began rioting, refusing to comply with the new socialist system and flying flags of the Papal Church. The situation is getting somewhat concerning to our government, as many fear a second civil war would destroy us beyond repair."
ww1_red_italy.25.a: "They need to calm down!"
ww1_red_italy.26.t: "Pope Begins Provoking Us"
ww1_red_italy.26.d: "The pretender in the vatican has began coverted criticism of our government, harshly condemning our policies and practically encouraging southerners to revolt.

ww1_red_italy.34.d: "Holidays such as Statuto Albertino Day and the Feast of the Unification that celebrate the old monarcho-bourgeois order of Italy have been abolished completely. Replacing them are several new holidays, with May International Workers Day now being made an offical state holiday, as well as a day of celebration for the date Rome fell to our revolutionary forces."

ww1_italy.144.t: "An Unexpected Advocate"
ww1_italy.145.t: "Womens Suffrage Ammendment Fails"
ww1_italy.145.d: "Perhaps to be expected, the womens suffrage ammendment pushed by socialists and suprisingly, a handful of hardline conservatives, have failed. With little support amongst the centrists who dominate parliament, the ammendment was shot down with it lacking around 100 votes needed to pass it."
ww1_italy.145.a: "Let's get to serious business, now."
ww1_italy.146.t: "Womens Suffrage Ammendment Passes"
ww1_italy.146.d: "In a quite suprising move, the ammendment to include women into Giolitti's male suffrage bill has passed. This comes as Sonnio agreed to support Giolittis proposed ammendment to have voting require a literacy test in return for Giolittis support for womens suffrage. With only 4 other countries having achieved such a monumental reform, Italy's sure to be on the right side of history."
ww1_italy.146.a: "It was worth it."
ww1_italy.144.d: "The new womens suffrage ammendment has recieved an unexpected endorsement: the full backing of Sidney Sonnino, leader of the conservative opposition. Being in charge of one of the most conservative wings of parliament, his endorsement has suprised many. Justifying his position in a speech to Italy's parliament, he's declared "It is only from universal suffrage that the government can achieve the strength amd legitimacy to represent and protect the general interests of Italy, which is continuously endangered by the particular interests of individuals, localities, and egotistical small interests groups."\n\nStill, the ammendment seems to lean towards failing. Many centrist members are hardly convinced by this argument, being more swayed by Giolittis idea of cautious expansaion of the electorate as Italians education and literacy increases. Gaetano Mosca, another influencial conservative, has also denounced the ammendment and called it a bridge too far."
ww1_italy.145.a: "That debates over, then"
ww1_italy.144.a: "Italy isn't ready for such a radical move yet"
ww1_italy.144.b: "You know what? We'll support it on the condition that literacy is a requirement to vote."
ww1_italy.143.t: "Ammendment on Womens Suffrage"
ww1_italy.143.d: "Some of the more left wing PM's have introduced an ammendment to the male suffrage bill Giolitti has proposed in parliament. The ammendment would change the language of the bill to grant full voting rights to all women of age. It would certainly be a radical move, as only Finland and Norway currently have laws allowing Women to vote. Still, this ammendment is expected to go no where for now."
ww1_italy.143.a: "We'll let it play out"
ww1_italy.141.t: "The 'Game' Isn't Fun Anymore"
ww1_italy.141.d: "Giolitti has often described politics as the 'gentlements game', and his political strategy has reflected that. Giolitti has no problem befriending radical socialists and conservative catholics at the same time, but the web of coalitions, promises, and alliances Giolitti has been employing is starting to frustrate Italian politicians as a whole. People want a genuine fighter, someone who they see as a more principled man. While Giolitti shouldn't exactly be called unprincipled, it's undeniable that Giolitti's web of political connections can frustrate those on both sides. The so-called 'Gentlemens Game' may not have players forever"
ww1_italy.141.a: "These predictions won't manifest"
ww1_italy.113.t: "The Legacy of Giolitti"
ww1_italy.113.d: "Giolitti has defined Italian politics for the last 30 years of our history. His legacy has been very mixed amongst leftist groups, with opinions ranging from his being a force for good who helped push many key reforms to Italian society to him being the greatest oppressor in Italy's history, whos policy of trasformismo helped crush workers across Italy. With our coalition containing people with views of Giolitti on both extreme ends, confronting the legacy of Giolitti has proven hard for Bissolati. How should we define this past era of Italian politics?"
ww1_italy.113.a: "Giolitti had his flaws, but he was one the better liberals."
ww1_italy.113.b: "Giolitti was a two faced scumbag who only had it out for himself!"
ww1_iw_italy.10.t: "Production Output Falls"
ww1_iw_italy.10.d: "As Italians get layed off and our industries fail to modernize, our industrial output is falling significantly. We must work towards solving the unemployment crisis and modernizing our factories if we wish to recover from this crisis. "
ww1_red_italy.39.t: "Federal-Syndicalism Achieved"
ww1_red_italy.39.d: "We've successfully built a working system for Italy's economy and society. From the working man, to the syndicate, to the national confederation of labour syndicates, a three tier system has been built up to help direct proper national development and ensure that all syndicates are collaborating in a way that benefits everyone. Although there is a problem of bureaucracy, Ambris knows that a fully anarchist system would have worse problems, and maybe even end up collapsing. "
ww1_red_italy.39.a: "The last chapter of Italian politics have closed, hopefully"
ww1_red_italy.38.t: "Anarcho-Syndicalism Achieved"
ww1_red_italy.38.d: "The syndicates of Italy need true freedom to operate. While the National Confederation of Labour Syndicates is great for a communication space of Italian unions, we cannot allow them to have regulatory power. Thus, the syndicates and ambris have elected to abolish all regulatory and legislative power that the NCLS previously enjoyed. For better or for worse, we've truly achieved anarchist syndicalism."
ww1_red_italy.38.a: "The last chapter of Italian politics have closed, hopefully"
ww1_red_italy.15.t: "Establishment of the National Confederation of Labour Syndicates"
ww1_red_italy.15.d: "Through decree, Ambris has established the confederation of labour syndicates. Dubbed 'The Brain' of the syndicate system, its expected that the confederation of labour syndicates will help coordinate all of Italy's local syndicates for proper future planning and encourage the enactment of general mutually benefical policies. As we help build a horizontal economy, the NCLS will be key. Eventually, we plan to make it the offical lower body of Italy's political system, where unions will vote to help dictate government policy."
ww1_red_italy.15.a: "They will help guide the syndicates!"
ww1_italy.251.t: "Coal Shortages"
ww1_italy.251.d: "The collapse of trade caused by being at war with half of Europe's great powers and the increased demand for coal to fuel our machines of war have caused a shortage of coal across the country.

ww1_italy.167.t: "Investing in Serbian Railways"
ww1_italy.167.d: "As a part of our attempt to increase our influence over the Balkans and create profitable partnerships, investment opprotunities in Serbias railways are being discussed. Investing in their railways will obviously increase our economic ties, but it will also have the added benefit of making future trade with them easier, if we pair this with investments in Montenegro."

ww1_italy.176.d: "With Serbias connection to Monternegro secured, Serbia is quickly buying up more and more Italian exports. It's leading to economic benefits for both sides, as Serbia gets resources for cheaper then Austria was selling them while our business men are seeing an uptick in profit from sales to Serbia."

ww1_italy.168.a: "Good news I suppose"
ww1_italy.170.t: "Expanding Montenegro's Ports"
ww1_italy.170.d: "Investments helping build up Montenegro's ports would help directly boost our exports to them as they'd be able to carry more of our ships. In addition, this combined with future investments in Serbia may help increase our trade with them as well. The project may be expensive, but it's likely to be worth it in the long run. Shall we proceed?"

ww1_italy.260.d: "Our government has made it's policy on military spending very clear: moderate increases to the budget are needed for Italy's national security. Rubini, the current Treasure Minister, has made very clear that he opposes an increase of spending on the military, pointing at Italy's current government deficit as proof that we cannot affoard such measures. With us increasing military spending anyways, Rubini has sent a letter to Salandra stating his intent to resign."
ww1_italy.379.t: "The Mobilization Strategy"
ww1_italy.379.d: "As we begin mobilizing the economy, the question of how the Mobilitazione Industriale should function has came up. Some are arguing for a centralized system based in rome which will give out orders across the country and the system works smoothly, while some want a decentralized system with regional sub-committees set up across different provinces, which would more effectively manage local industries and solve local problems, although the system may be a bit slower overall. What should we do?"

He sees the blow to his government as significant, and believes the political situation would improve with his resignation. The King has been far from supportive of the idea of Salandra resigning, although there may be a tolerable sucessor to him if he does: Giolitti. What should the fate of Salandra be?"

ww1_italy.380.d: "The king today has signed a order at the recommendation of Luigi Torre establishing an excpetion for conscription granted to workers that work in industries delegated as key to the war effort. This has increased interest in these industries, as workers have began trying to get jobs in these industries so they can avoid having to fight on the front. As a result, war industries have began to grow in size."

The textile workers who have seen their comrades across other industries see an increase in their working standards are angry that their wages, saftey standards, and break days have seen zero changes in years. As a result, strikes in the industry are increasing, hurting our economy and thus the war effort."

ww1_italy.385.d: "Our mobilization program is seeing lots of rural farmers in the south seek jobs in the war industry, wanting to secure higher wages for their family compared to the poverty they're used to from low profit farming. Their enthuiasism, or maybe more accurately, their desperation, is helping speed up our mobilization. Unfortuantely, it is also leading to lower food production as they abandon their farming jobs."

ww1_italy.401.d: "Woodrow Wilson had previously attempted to mediate an end to the war with his foolish idealistic dreams of a world with no conflict or wars, of course failing miserably in his attempts. Now, Wilson has brought his country into the Entente, and is already attempting to influence the peace treaty after we win. He's proposed ideas of self determination, claiming people in territories should vote to decide which country they want to join after the war. He's extended this theory to the balkans, attempting to force us to hold referendums in Austrian land promised to us after the war, some of which would probably vote against us. Although if our performance is strong enough we may be able to ignore Wilson's demands, if it isn't, the Entente may force us to bend to his will."

In a tight vote, Filippo Corridoni has secured the support of a majority of unions, making vast promises to strengthen Italy's economy and national position. Filippo's nationalist tendencies garnered him lots of suspicion from unios across Italy, and he's expected to take a more expansionist position on issues world wide."

ww1_red_italy.31.d: "From the days of the Renaissance, Italian culture has been dominated by the upper classes of society. The arts, media, and education is dominated by bourgeois and monarchist elements of society. Ambris seeks a fundemental reconstruction of Italian society, which a cultural revolution will provide. We must ensure Italian culture and society is dominated by the proletariat, and we will."

We have already given orders for all royal and bourgeois elements of these schools and academies to be removed, and for them to be transformed into regular schools scrubbed completely of their monarchist and bourgeois elements. The large monarchist and bourgeois statues and extravagant displays of wealth have been pocketed and sold, with the funds to be used for better projects."

ww1_italy.169.d: "As a great power, Italy deserves a sphere of influence, and the Balkans are the perfect place to build one. The problem, however, lies in the fact that our Austrian allies completely dominate the Balkans as of currently. Holding immense economic influence over the Balkans, Austria currently has large leverage over them. a leverage that the Balkan countries are well aware of, making many of them uncomfortable. Thus, we have the chance to offer the Balkans a way out: partnership with Italy. We can offer Balkan countries moderate sized investments in their country in an attempt to sway them away from Vienna and help tie our economies together."

With the political stability of Italy in the dumpster fire at this point, nationalists have gotten violent. ANI leaders have been organizing political militias which are causing chaos across the nation. With corruption rampant and our general unpopularity amongst buercrats in the country, our ability to neuter these organizations is completely gone, at least for now.

During Giolittis 4th term, Giolitti worked hard to shift the catholic church towards the left, which he saw as the best way to eventually replace the PSI later down the road. Although there has been a rise in leftist catholics in politics, the accension of one to the PM spot suprised many. Giolitti strongly reccomanded the King appooint Murri, seeing him as the best way to both combat the rising anarchist movement as well as keep Italy moving into the future."

Although the radicals will get their chance one day, Giolitti has decided stragetically to reccomended to the King a nationalist, such as Enrico Corradini, be allowed to form a government. He theorizes that although they are quite radical, they're no true threat to the establishment, and that having their own government should force them to moderate at least slightly. Besides, if things go wrong, the king can just kick him from office."
ww1_italy.355.a: "Well its quite the gambit, but ok"
ww1_italy.134.d: "While judicial review does dejure exist in Italy, judges can indeed severely mutilate laws through defacto powers. Although the Council of State has no ability to rule on parliamentry action, they can review administartion acts. Through rather generous interpretations of their our power, judges have used this to block all kinds of socialist action. Although never a serious problem before, with socialists in power the judges are now able to seriously hinder our ability to implement our agenda. Thus, we need to somehow deal with the judges. Laws protecting judicial independence mean an outright purge is off the table, but we still have means at our disposal. Judges can be removed if they are charged for corruption or misconduct. In addition, we have legal authority to shuffle judges around if minor positions open up, meaning we could place more anti socialist judges in lower authority positions and replace their high authority position with more friendly judges.

Italy's parliament is now deeply radical, deeply polarized, and has a deep hatred for Salandra. With such a horrible election showing, and him now giving up his granted emergency powers, it seems Salandra will have to resign himself, within a few weeks."

The decree has given [ITA.GetLeader] permission to appoint members of the government as well as pass laws without the consent of parliament. These expansive powers have made him a dictator in all but name, de facto dictator, if you will. With him now holding the power to rapidly implement his reforms to strengthen the military and ensure Italy is prepared for a coming European war."

With Italy's parliament deeply polarized and no politicians able to or wanting to take the mantle of Prime Minister, Emmanuel has taken drastic action. Current chief of staff Pollio, a moderate conservative, has been offered the role of Prime Minister. Although lacking some support in parliament, the king's unexpected appointment of a military offical to the spot of prime minister has spooked most of parliament, who fear a return to the days of Italy's authoritarianism under Crispi, into supporting Pollio rather then risking a possible persecution. "
ww1_italy.318.d: "Giolittis failure to pass suffrage reform and subsequent collapse of his government has taken Italy's parliamentry members and king by suprise. With weeks having passed, all attempts to form a new government have failed. Conservatives like Sonnio and Salandra have been blocked by the left, leftists like Nitti have been blocked by the right, and all centrist canidates seem uninterested in becoming prime minister, seeing the domestic situation as unfavorable.

Only a few in Italy mourn his passing, while most give the day little care. Umberto governed as a right wing authoritarian, disrespecting the authority of parliament and appointing puppet PM's who generally did whatever he commanded. Quite different from Emmanuel, Umberto was very active in politics mananging much of the country's foreign policy and heavily influencing his puppet PM's to do his bidding. He was especially harsh against socialists, with multiple outright massacres of striking workers occuring under his administration."

The establishment of parliament suprised many, although was expected to be a simple formality that would have no defacto power when comapred to the party elite that would actually rule Italy. The ascension of the reformists as well as the series of moderate acts taken by parliament certainly suprised international observers, and it's become clear to many that the post revolutionary Italy will indeed be a sucessful democracy. Achieving a true socialist utopia under a democratic system is certainly idealistic, but if anyone can do it, it's us."

While many glorify the days of the Roman empire, they have few nice things to say about Italy in its current state, maybe justifiably so. Firmly in the third rank of European powers, Italy has earned little respect across the world. Being given a pitiful piece of land in the Horn of Africa after being denied repeatably its actual claims, losing a war to Ethiopia, and having a military hardly better then the decaying Turkish empire are just a few examples of Italy's weakness on the world stage, and you'll often here the loudest critics of Italy coming from the nationalists. The call for radical change to make an Italy able to achieve the glory it deserves. Militarism, anti liberalism, and an aggressive foreign policy are all points you'll hear nationalists make. Assuming nothing dramatic changes, we can expect nationalist circles who claim to love Italy continue to insult it more then any so called “unpatriotic“ liberal would."

The north, while not exactly Paris or London, lives in relative luxury, certainly living more lavishly then someone in Warsaw or Sofia. The south is, however, home to some of the poorest in Europe. Only living moderately better then Russian peasants, Italian farmers down south have been crushed by the North-focused policies of previous Italian governments, and left plundered by the practically colonial level treatment of southern farmlands for the benefit of the North. While many try to live their lives, holding bitter resentment, many have decided to flee the country. Most prevalent in the 1880's, millions of Italians have left to other countries - particularly the east coast of the United States. While emigration has slowed down, it's still very much ongoing in the South. This has led to a variety of issues - certainly our ego has been bruised by this, but the economics of losing millions of people certainly aren't helping Italy right now either."

Playing a key part in Giolittis government, the radicals have successfully convinced Italy's political elite that they are a moderate enough party to lead an actual government. With the leftist union producting a very progressive parliament, the radicals have thus been picked as a compromise to sway the liberal left as well as get the PSI to at least tolerate the new prime minister."

Their opposition to the King's will expressed through him was to be expected, though it would be much more preferable if those seats were not theirs to take in the first place. The Radicals had fallen in line, albeit reluctantly. Any chance at progressive reform is gone, much to their chagrin. Lastly, the Liberals looked content, though perhaps they shouldn't be. Their current situation was not exactly ideal, but perhaps they would find a new Giolitti within [ITA.GetLeader]. Only he knew if that was to come, and his eyes wrinkled at the thought. Another thought crossed his mind: shall today be one of an iron fist or a velvet glove?

ww1_italy.334.d1: "The Abruzzo region has been hit with a devestating 6.7-magnitude earthquake (estimates go up to 7.5). This comes after the two Sicily quakes of 1908 and 1914. This disaster claimed the lives of over 30,000 Italians. The city of Avezzano was left in complete ruins and the vibrations were felt in the Italian capital Rome. According to experts, 96% of Abruzzo residents in the epicenter were killed almost simultaneously. Since many homes were built out of simple rocks, mortar, and wood, the structures that were not meant for this type of disaster were crumbled by the tremor."

According to experts, 96% of Abruzzo residents in the epicenter were killed almost simultaneously. Since many homes were built out of simple rocks, mortar, and wood, the structures that were not meant for this type of disaster were crumbled by the tremor. Due to the Great War, the Italian government has decided not to accept foreign aid."
ww1_italy.343.t: "Public Fails To 'Rally Around The Flag'"
ww1_italy.343.d: "Despite the attempts from our government to frame the war as a war of patriotic liberation of Italians outside of our border, our involvement in the great war remains unpopular amongst our people. The vast majority of Italians see the war as a blood bath and something Italy has no reason to involve itself in, with many even being outright hostile to the war. Attempts to rally the population to take measures to aid the war effort are failing, and anarchists are no doubt attempting to undermine us."
ww1_italy.343.a: "They have no love for their country!"
ww1_red_italy.114.t: "Italy wishes to negotiate investment"
ww1_red_italy.114.d: "The new socialist Italian government would like to open up their country for help inquiring development of national industries in exchange for some resources such as their aluminum, chromium or steel."
ww1_red_italy.114.a: "We would like aluminum in return"
ww1_red_italy.114.b: "We would like chromium in return"
ww1_red_italy.114.c: "We would like steel in return"
ww1_red_italy.114.e: "We are not interested in investing"
ww1_red_italy.115.t: "Austria agrees to trade deal"
ww1_red_italy.115.d: "See below for what resources were traded and for the stats: Austria has announced today that they have agreed to our trade deal proposal, which gives them minerals and they give us more access to civilian factory funding and power."
ww1_red_italy.115.a: "Art of the Deal"
ww1_red_italy.116.t: "Austria refuses trade deal"
ww1_red_italy.116.d: "The Austrian delegate to Rome has told us today that they will not be agreeing to this trade deal as it seems 'unfair'."
ww1_red_italy.116.a: "Whaaaaaat?"
ww1_red_italy.117.t: "The End of Money"
ww1_red_italy.117.d: "With the circulation of the Lira now being illegal, many groups of people have been seen profiteering from this government measure to remove capitalistic features in our future economy, which is a bit ironic. Since foreign goods still requires money, black market organizations like the Mafia have been seen stockpiling Lira, and using said currency to buy illicit material, converting it to foreign currencies."
ww1_red_italy.117.a: "Shady!"
ww1_red_italy.118.t: "Mafia causes Southern Distrust"
ww1_red_italy.118.d: "The Italian South, an area that many anti-communists reside have been invaded by the Italian Mafia. The Mafias have been able to successfully position their public view as protectors against the evil communist regime and for economic stability and traditional values. Many villages have been de facto overtaken by the Mafia as they collect more taxes from the citizens to keep their shady illegal actions funded."
ww1_red_italy.118.a: "The Mafia has been going on for far too long!"
ww1_red_italy.119.t: "Southerners Unhappy about Suppression of Religion"
ww1_red_italy.119.d: "Ever since we have declared our state-wide war on religion, many religious southerners have expressed discontent about said war saying it violates their traditional way of life."
ww1_red_italy.119.a: "You never had a choice."

ww1_red_italy.98.t: "Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action"
ww1_red_italy.98.d: "Although there is room for debating the best policies within the party, outright dissent from politicians after a policy proposal is accepted undermines our nation and is not accepted. This system will help ensure that we get the benefit of everyone sharing their best ideas, without the negatives of political debate leading to disunity and disorder."
ww1_red_italy.98.a: "The perfect form of democracy."
ITA_non_ag.tt: "Modify §YSocial Unrest§! by\n$communism_drift$: §G+0.03§!\n$MODIFIER_POLITICAL_POWER_FACTOR$: §R-10%§!\n$MODIFIER_STABILITY_FACTOR$: §G+5.00%§!"
ww1_red_italy.46.t: "Toleration of Non-Subversive Ideologies"
ww1_red_italy.46.d: "A core tenant of the non aggression principal is that people should have the right to believe in whatever ideology they wish as long as they dont to violate others liberty. Italy has a large diversity of political thought, which must be protected. As long as these people do not seek the construction of a strong national state, they should be free to believe whatever they want."
ww1_red_italy.46.a: "This will hopefully reduce societal tensions"
ww1_red_italy.30.t: "The Human Rights Ammendments"
ww1_red_italy.30.d: "Italy's new constitution, while a vast improvement from the old one, obviously needs more work to transform Italy into a true syndicalist society. With the passage of the so-called human rights ammendments, we've now enshrined the right for all Italian citizens to have access to a good education, healthcare, housing, and food. Although these guarantees will not be provided by the state, the state will indeed help local syndicates run the systems that will provide these goods for all."
ww1_red_italy.30.a: "how can you deny the human right to any of these?"
ww1_red_italy.75.t: "A Strong Leader"
ww1_red_italy.75.d: "Elections for the head of the PSI have concluded, with prevailing over a variety of reformists, anarchists, and other maximalists. Mussolini is quite controversial in the PSI, making his upset victory somewhat unepected. Mussolini is a outspoken interventionalist as well as a believer in a strong national state, two positions that have made him many enemies in the party."
ww1_red_italy.75.a: "He's suited to secure the revolution"
ww1_italy.441.t: "Cadorna Implements Decimation of Underperforming Units"
ww1_italy.441.d: "To restore the warrior spirit of the Italian people and motivate soldiers to fight for the motherland with all their strength, Cadorna has implemented a national policy of executing every 10th soldier in a failing brigade to their deaths. If soldiers want to avoid this fate, they can simply perform better in war."
ww1_italy.441.a: "Seems rational"
ww1_italy.447.t: "Carabinieri Occupies Cities"
ww1_italy.442.t: "Cadorna appointed Chief of Staff"
ww1_italy.442.d: "After the passing of Alberto Pollio, the King has appointed Luigi Cadorna as Chief of Staff. Cadorna was reluctant at first, but after being promised by the King he would have complete control of the army he accepted."
ww1_italy.442.a: "Good luck Cadorna!"
ww1_italy.445.t: "Repetitive Offensives Damaging our Morale"
ww1_italy.445.d: "The morale of soldiers in our army is decreasing as we continue our relentless assaults, charging at enemy positions the same way time and time again just to get shot down by enemy machine guns, with only a few weeks of rest between these assaults. Cadorna believes that a constant attack is needed to keep enemy morale down, but it seems the tactic is just not working and is only damaging our morale."
ww1_italy.445.a: "Those soldiers just need some disciplining!"
ww1_italy.446.t: "Armies pushed to the Piave!"
ww1_italy.446.d: "Our army has just been pushed all the way out of Eastern Veneto, past the Tagliamento to the Piave river by the Austrian forces, and cities such as Venice and Treviso are in immediate danger to the Austrian army. The Austrian forces cannot be let to push our forces any further, and we must make a last stand on the Piave river, at all costs."
ww1_italy.446.a: "Hold the Piave!"
ww1_iw_italy.14.t: "Right Wing Government Toppled"
ww1_iw_italy.14.d: "With the outbreak of mass unrest up north, centrists have allied with socialists to force out the current right wing government. They see our government as unfit to address the current crisis, fearing we'd only escalate things."
ww1_iw_italy.14.a: "They've just made a grand mistake!"
ww1_iw_italy.60.t: "King Dismisses Cadorna"
ww1_iw_italy.60.d: "Despite protests from the Cadorna, the king has put an end to the emergency powers granted to Cadorna and restored a civilian government. For now, Nitti has been appointed prime minister as a compromise between liberals and angry leftists, although new elections are expected to be held soon."
ww1_iw_italy.60.a: "Let's hope restoring civilian control was a good idea"
ww1_iw_br_italy.33.t: "Rise of Cattling"
ww1_iw_br_italy.33.d: "Across the rural south, a increase of cattling is being reported. Farmers are seeing their animals be stolen by criminals who then pawn the animals off for a higher price. It's getting out of control, and we need to tackle it soon."
ww1_iw_br_italy.33.a: "Crazy"
ww1_iw_br_italy.34.t: "General Strike in Solidarity with Socialist Movements World Wide Declared"
ww1_iw_br_italy.34.d: "Socialists across the developed world have began to organize a strike in solidarity with revolutionary movements across the world. It's expected to be one of the largest strikes ever organized in the world, if all goes well for the planners. Currently, it has the attention of..."
ww1_iw_br_italy.34.a: "A million Italians"
ww1_iw_br_italy.34.b: "Millions of Italians!"
ww1_italy.413.t: "Italy Demands To Restore The Treaty of Wuchale"
ww1_italy.413.d: "Italy seeks to restore the Treaty of Wuchale, on their terms! If we were to agree we'd become a protectorate and restrictions to our trade would be restricted... if we were to decline it seems Italy wishes for another war..."
ww1_italy.413.a: "It's for the best we accept"
ww1_italy.413.b: "It's going to be 1896 all over again!"
ww1_italy.414.t: "Ethiopia Rejects Our Demands"
ww1_italy.414.d: "Ethiopia has rejected our demands, calling the Treaty of Wuchale a disgrace to both of our nations. Advisors say that they are mobilizing, expecting a pending invasion..."
ww1_italy.414.a: "They should've taken the deal"
ww1_italy.415.t: "Ethiopia Signs The Treaty of Wuchale"
ww1_italy.415.d: "Ethiopia has wisely chosen to restore the Treaty of Wuchale, which they signed over the role of the defense of the country to us. Not a single soldier died during this!"
ww1_italy.415.a: "Art of the deal!"
ww1_red_italy.89.t: "Asscension of the Party Elite"
ww1_red_italy.89.d: "Although we agreed to set up a parliament dejure, the construction of the government of the socialist republic has seen a extreme concentration of power in the hands of a few higher ups in the party. Parliamentry members have been mostly subordinated to the will of the most influencial party men, and the union leadership, finding itself divided, have failed to assert their place in the new Italian government. The next prime minister, Lazzari, accended mostly as a comrpomise canidate between the competing party elites in the PSI."
ww1_red_italy.89.a: "Italy needs forceful leadership right now anyways."
ww1_red_italy.21.t: "The Nationalization of Industry"
ww1_red_italy.21.d: "As we begin rebuilding our country from the civil war, we've began the rapid nationalization of Italian industry. Businesses have of course began to flee the country, but not at a more rapid rate then they were when we first captured Rome. The mass nationalization has given us much greater control over Italy's small industrial base, which we will hopefully be able to utilize well enough to rebuild stronger than ever before, either through handing it to workers councils or by having the government manage it."
ww1_red_italy.21.a: "Excellent!"
ww1_iw_italy.7.t: "The Crisis of Confidence"
ww1_iw_italy.7.d: "As the economy slips and slides downwards, Italians are losing faith in their political leaders. People want a shakeup in leadership, and bold and immediate reform. Our incumbency is dragging our support down dramatically."
ww1_iw_italy.7.a: "Do they expect us to fix everything in one day?"
ww1_italy.402.t: "A Country on the Brink"
ww1_italy.402.d: "As the king takes the unprecedented move of suspending parliament, socialists riots intensify in the north, and the ANI continues expanding their support across the lower class, the nation appears to be on the brink. The suspension of civil liberties has been met with a very mixed response by the political establishment. The radical party has completely denouced the move, and its seemingly reversing a lot of the moderate platform the party adopted in the last 10 years. Giolitti's liberals are cautious, waiting for the situation to develop, although in no world support a permanent king dictatorship. Salandra and Sonnino have thrown their support behind the kings moves, although also appear to be eyeing an eventual return to constitutionalism."
ww1_italy.402.a: "Careful governance is needed."
ww1_italy.374.t: "Inflation Soars"
ww1_italy.374.d: "Inflation has been climbing rapidly recently. Although at the start of the great war, inflation rose around 7%, in the last few months its began nearly doubling every week. People have seen the price of bread and basic goods nearly triple, and Italian wages are not at all keeping up with the rapid rise in prices. The most recent inflation report put our inflation rate at nearly 150%, with no sign of inflation slowing down."
ww1_italy.374.a: "Jesus!"
ww1_red_italy.4.t: "A Nation in Ruins"
ww1_red_italy.4.d: "We've won the civil war, and the country now lays in ruins. Heavy fighting up north has damaged much of Italy's industrial base and crippled our economy, with our GDP contracting an estimated 20% in the aftermath. Foreign enterprises have rapidly pulled out of Italy and prices have sky rocketed. Unemployment has soared to new heights, and our economy is going to need years to recover."
ww1_red_italy.4.a: "We'll build back even better!"
ww1_iw_italy.16.t: "Sharp Decline in Agricultural Production"
ww1_iw_italy.16.d: "The poor economic conditions are impacting those with low income the most, which just so happens to primarily be farmers. This, combined with our reduction in war time price controls and subsidies has lead to many farmers going completely bankrupt. As a result, our agricultural production in several sectors have collapsed by nearly 30%, spiking food prices."
ww1_iw_italy.16.a: "If only we had the money to help them"
ww1_italy.131.t: "Fate of the Carrot Tariffs"
ww1_italy.131.d: "With across the board tariff reductions on agricultural products, a unique and unexpected lobbying effort to keep tariffs on one such product has gained steam: carrots. Local carrot formers in Terni have begun large scale demonstrations demanding we keep the carrot tariffs in place. They claim without them, carrots from foreign countries will flood the local market place at prices they cannot afford. Thus, they would go backrupt and have their very way of life ruined.\n\nSuprisingly, Italian nationalists have used these farmers as a rallying point, using the farmers as examples of every day Italians who will have their life dramatically worsened by the reduction of tariffs. The decision is ours, shall we accept their appeal?"
ww1_italy.131.a: "Alas, the carrot tariff must fall"
ww1_italy.131.b: "They can have their carrot tariff, I suppose"
ww1_italy.142.t: "Supply Chains Suffering"
ww1_italy.142.d: "Many industries across Italy relied on cheap access to German steel for their production. With our new tariffs, they're starting to struggle. The tariffs are indeed bringing back jobs and proving to be quite popular, but industries who relied on German steel are now raising their prices."
ww1_italy.142.a: "We're just going through a little tough love"
ww1_red_italy.35.t: "Conversion of Mansions Into Schools"
ww1_red_italy.35.d: "Old large wealthy estates of the bourgeois which have now been seized by our state have been collecting cobwebs for the last few months. To repurpose these large estates, we've began converting these mansions into large libraries and schools for Italian children."
ww1_red_italy.35.a: "That's better"
ww1_italy.337.t: "Left Attempts New Series Of Reforms"
ww1_italy.337.d: "Italian leftists are attempting to push through several new reforms into law. These reforms are, of course, misguided and will do more harm then good. We must attempt to block these reforms before they go through, for the good of italy."
ww1_italy.337.a: "We'll see what we can do"
ww1_italy.177.t: "Extent of the Crimes of Capitalism"
ww1_italy.177.d: "Massacares, supression of unions, complicity with election rigging.\n\nThe response to the information that has been publicly revealed by the government is immediate. Protests have broken out across the country calling for the crimes of the past to be brought to justice, long standing liberal and conservative MP's are having a hard time explaining their complicity in massacares of workers, and the working class is more committed to socialism then ever."
ww1_italy.177.a: "It's time to move Italy towards a new era!"
ww1_italy.178.t: "Actions Have Consequences"
ww1_italy.178.d: "The extend in which capitalists have used what practically amounts to private militias to supress socialist voters up north in previous elections simply cannot be ignored. Our base is angry, they want justice. Quite rightfully so. We should look into formally charging these people with the crimes they committed"
ww1_italy.178.a: "They feared the liberation of the people, and now they will fear the peoples justice."
ww1_red_italy.94.t: "Crisis in the Party"
ww1_red_italy.94.d: "Our new league of revolutionary action has caused a crisis in the party. Full of pacifists, the party has been deeply divided by our open endorsement of interventionalism, with many of them leaving our government in protest. Still, our rule is quite secure, and they do not have the political capital to expel us from government."
ww1_red_italy.94.a: "They can have it their way!"
ww1_red_italy.76.t: "Maximalists Expell Democratic Socialists"
ww1_red_italy.76.d: "The democratic socialists have long found themselves staunchly opposed to the authoritarian and revolutionary tendencies of the maximalists, and after the insurection in the south, many maximalist politicians have outright accused the democratic socialists as subversive to the revolution, claiming they seek the destruction of the revolutionary state and a return to the broken bourgeois dominated parliament seen in the monarchy era. Utilizing the new recent anti-dissent laws, maximalists in parliament have voted to expell large swaths of current democratic socialists who hold seats in parliament and ministries in government."
ww1_red_italy.76.a: "Are we cannibalising ourselves, or are we protecting the revolution?"
ww1_italy.339.t: "Protesters Clash with Police"
ww1_italy.339.d: "The police started shooting at a rally in Emilia. This rally was organized by Cesare Battisti, a socialist irredentist of the Trentino region. The goal of the rally is to protest against Italy's neutrality as Cesare is for Italy's involvement in the war. One protester ended up being shot and many others were injured. Many journals critise the police's use of violence during the demonstration."
ww1_italy.339.a: "They should've stayed off the streets!"
ww1_italy.339.b: "What the heck?!"
ww1_red_italy.13.t: "Major Constitution Changes Finished"
ww1_red_italy.13.d: "While theres still some scrubbing of monarchist ideals left to complete before we can finalize the new consitution, we've settled most major debates with consitutional changes, thus we can expect the new constitution to take effect in mere days."
ww1_red_italy.13.a: "Finally, a truly just consitution..."
ww1_red_italy.59.t: "Mafia Pacified"
ww1_red_italy.59.d: "Our war on the mafia, although taking nearly a year, has succeeded. A large percentage of the mafia has been arrested, with the rest being driven underground and weakened to the point of no longer being a serious threat to Italy. This has dramatically increased our popularity amongst southerners who detest the mafia as well as ensured the mafia can no longer oppose our regime."
ww1_red_italy.59.a: "The bastards are finally gone"
ww1_red_italy.69.t: "Fate of Seized Assets"
ww1_red_italy.69.d: "We've found ourself in possession of an immensely large amount of money from the seized assets of capitlists who fled the country. Holding onto these assets ourself provides no value to us, and thus we must sell them the highest foreign bidder then use the funds on one of our domestic priorities. What should we spend the extra funds on?"
ww1_iw_italy.10.a: "BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. Italy will be bigger and better than ever before!"
ww1_red_italy.69.a: "The money can go into universities"
ww1_red_italy.69.b: "This money will help reduce our deficit"
ww1_red_italy.69.c: "The money will be invested into our infrastructure"
ww1_red_italy.69.e: "We'll invest the money into government industrialization projects"
ww1_red_italy.70.t: "Socialists Feel Betrayed"
ww1_red_italy.70.d: "Workers who took up arms against the monarchy did not do it to see a government taking half-measures. Our policy of selective socialism and allowing some private business have lead to workers feeling like we've betrayed the revolutionary movement. They are beginning to support other leftist factions who promise bigger and bolder reforms."
ww1_red_italy.70.a: "They just don't understand"
ww1_italy.425.t: "Presenting The First Round of Demands"
ww1_italy.425.d: "With our main territorial desires from the Entente being in France, we shall first make our just demands in France to the central powers. We will seek to right the wrong of the Tunisia humilation, expand Italian East Africa, and recieve Nice and Savony once again."
ww1_italy.425.a: "Should be relatively uncontroversial, you'd think."
ww1_red_italy.71.t: "Parliamentary Opposition Growing"
ww1_red_italy.71.d: "Our explusion of reformist socialists from the government has lead to anger from members of parliament. They see us as attempting a power grab and undermining democracy. Although theres nothing they can do right now, our continued attempts to secure power over the party may lead to them attempting to spark a government coalition. As it stands right now however, the opposing groups in parliament are much too divided to bring foward a united motion."
ww1_red_italy.71.a: "If only we didn't have to listen to these brats..."
ww1_iw_italy.17.t: "The Solution to Food Shortages"
ww1_iw_italy.17.d: "As our agricultural production goes through a historic downturn, the situation has gotten to the point where state intervention is necessary. Our finances are already quite tight, so a massive cash injection to the agricultural crash may not be affoardable. We could instead lower agricultural tariffs, which would allow a flood of cheap food imports which would help alievate food prices, although our trade deficit would be sure to expand if we take this course of action."
ww1_iw_italy.17.b: "We should begin bailing out farmers and boosting subsidies"
ww1_iw_italy.17.a: "Loosen tariffs and encourage more imports"
ww1_italy.130.t: "Farmer Aid Program Proving to be Wasteful"
ww1_italy.130.d: "With our free trade based policies seeing our agricultural exports soar to new highs, our recent farmer aid program has proven to just simply not be all that necessary. While programs like these usually end up dramatically reducing issues like poverty, with the strong performance of our farmers the program is becoming much more expensive then its worth. We must rule on if the program is worth keeping and running a large deficit on, as it has had some small scale sucesses, or scrapping all together."
ww1_italy.130.a: "Despite its muted effects on poverty reduction, its worth keeping"
ww1_italy.130.b: "Let's just scrap the program"
ww1_red_italy.91.c: "Antonio Gramsci"
ww1_italy.286.t: "Things That Never Were"
ww1_italy.286.d: "When nationalist writers across Italy were attempting to rally support for a war with the Ottoman Empire, they often claimed that Libya would be a gold mine for Italy - both literally and metaphorically. Italians were promised an abundence of natural resources, friendly locals, and cheap fancy homes on the warm Libyan coast. With Libya having been under our control for nearly half a year at this point, it's clear these ideas were nothing more then a fantasy. On the contrary to having a large supply of natural resoures, Libya is becoming a drain on the economy. Natives are waging a brutal guerilla war, and Italians are more interested in moving to Chicago than experiencing Libyan carnage in Tripoli."
ww1_italy.286.a: "We went all the way, and for what?"
ww1_italy_dev.1.t: "Debug Event - Navy Variables reset"
ww1_italy_dev.2.t: "Debug Event - Relationship with Labour"

ww1_red_italy.40.t: "Instituting Ferrer's Modern School Movement"
ww1_red_italy.40.d: "Francisco Ferrer of Spain has revolutionized ideas of schools and education across the world. Opening schools in Spain and The United States, Ferrer has attempted to foster a learning enviornment that truly teaches kids how to natually learn and think for themselves. Religion as well as the state is completely removed from schools, while children are taught a combination of manual and intellectual working skills for their future indepedence. Teachers are to use their own improvised curriculum rather than a state one, to ensure children are learning what will benefit them the most. "
ww1_red_italy.40.a: "A very positive change!"

ww1_italy.453.t: "Italy Joins the Entente"
ww1_italy.453.d: "Today, Italy has joined the side of the Entente powers and has declared war on Austria, ditching their Triple Alliance allies after concluding the secret Treaty of London. In the Treaty of London, the Entente promised Austrian territories after the war and other concessions to Italy in return for Italy joining the Entente.\nThe Italian entry into the war has created a new front for the Central Powers to worry about, and the war along the peaks of the Alpine mountains will surely by a costly one."
ww1_italy.453.a: "Together we'll win this!"
ww1_italy.453.b: "Traitors!"
ww1_italy.453.c: "Suprising!"
ww1_italy.453.e: "Avanti Savoia!"
ww1_italy.454.t: "Italy Joins the Central Powers"
ww1_italy.454.d: "Today, Italy has joined the Central Powers and declared war against France after concluding a series of negotiations with Germany and Austria. The Germans have promised to give Italy French territory after the war and many other concessions.\nThe Italian entry into the war could divert many valuable French troops from the German front to the new front in the Alpine mountains against the Italians."
ww1_italy.454.a: "An alliance honoured."
ww1_italy.454.b: "We will beat those fools!"
ww1_iw_italy.64.t: "Marcia su Roma"
ww1_iw_italy.64.d: "The leaders of Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista have organized a march on our capital. [ITA.GetLeader] wished to declare a state of siege against the blackshirt demonstration, but it was overruled by King Victor Emmanuel III. The King has decided to transfer all ministerial powers from [ITA.GetLeader] to Benito in fear of civil war."
ww1_iw_italy.64.a: "Peaceful takeover."
ww1_italy.455.t: "The Return of the Italians"
ww1_italy.455.d: "The Italians have landed on our shores today, demanding that we restore the treaties we formally signed with them before Italy fell into civil war and their authority over us and the region collapsed. We pratically have no choice now but accept their demands as there are thousands of Italian soldiers in our capital."
ww1_italy.455.a: "Well, what can we do but sign them?"
ww1_italy.456.t: "[FROM.GetName] accepts our demands!"
ww1_italy.456.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demand for them to restore the treaties we signed with them before the outbreak of civil war in our country and their abandonment of the treaties."

ww1_italy_tutorial.1.t: "The Italian Economy"
ww1_italy_tutorial.1.d: "There are two national spirits that affect your industrial capacity and performance: 'Industrialization Program' and 'Social Unrest.' These national spirits are modified through many ways, like the focus tree, decisions, events and more.\n\nThere are two economy paths for you to choose as Italy: Protectionism and Free Trade. Protectionism offers a trade of higher consumer goods factor in exchange of higher construction speed of civilian factories, and Free Trade offers a short-term debuff for a long-term success."
ww1_italy_tutorial.1.a: "Ok"

ww1_italy_tutorial.2.t: "The Italian Army/Airforce"
ww1_italy_tutorial.2.d: "There is one national spirit affecting the Italian Army: 'Regio Esercito'. You will have to go through the army focus tree in order to remove/reduce the debuffs presented. \n\nTowards the middle section of the branch, you have the option to either increase production, increase defensive capabilities or to have extra artillery damage. Focuses after that choice are war focuses intended to be taken during the Great War. \n\nThe Italian Airforce's stats are included in the same national spirit as the army's."

ww1_italy_tutorial.3.t: "The Italian Navy"
ww1_italy_tutorial.3.d: "The Italian navy's stat modifiers are viewable through the national spirit of 'Outdated Fleet'. (A name change may occur after completing a focus)\n\nThese stats can be buffed through the naval tree: where you also have an important choice to make. You can improve the navy but ignore some army buffs: the choice is upto you."

ww1_italy_tutorial.4.t: "Upcoming Libya War"
ww1_italy_tutorial.4.d: "The Libya war needs to be triggered from a decision unlocked from the focus 'Prepare for the Walk Down South'. This focus also unlocks decisions that you can do for various useful stat buffs. Make sure to complete some of these before sending the ultimatum. We recommend putting up your fleet and setting active naval invasion orders before declaring in order to have a higher success at winning."

ww1_italy_tutorial.5.t: "Naval supremacy in the Libya War"
ww1_italy_tutorial.5.d: "If you have difficulty gaining naval supremacy, try splitting your fleet and setting it to a higher engagement level and a lower repair level. This will make it so that after a fight with the Ottoman navy, they will go repair (thus losing superiority) whilst you have more fleets for an invasion."

ww1_italy_tutorial.6.t: "1910 Term of Giovanni Giolitti"
ww1_italy_tutorial.6.d: "Giovanni Giolitti has been leader of Italy a couple times before. When Giolitti arrives into office, a new parliament mechanic will unlock in your decisions tab. Make sure to keep a close eye, as if less than 254 members of parliament support Giolitti, a vote of no confidence will happen, and he'll be forced to resign. You can gain support of members of parliament via the focus tree, gaining support from either the Socialists, the Radicals, The Sinistra (the Leftists) and the Destra (the Rightists) via the system of Trasformismo. You will lose 140 members if you do not complete the focus 'Full Male Suffrage' by 600 days of the starting term of Giolitti."

ww1_italy_tutorial.7.t: "Giolitti's Successors"
ww1_italy_tutorial.7.d: "If you weren't careful enough, and less than 254 members of parliament supported you, Giolitti will resign, and a successor will be chosen based on your decisions in the political tree. You can read the requirements of your prefered choice, which are listed under various focuses branching off of 'The Failure of Trasformismo'. \nFor example, if you want to get Antonio Salandra as leader, you will have to form the Liberal Union and complete at least 1 Left Wing focus OR lose the Libya War.\n\nA failure to complete any of the requirements necessary to get any successor will lead to Alberto Pollio, the Italian Military commander-in-chief to take the lead."
ww1_italy_tutorial.7.b: "What's the Liberal Union and the Leftist Union?"

ww1_italy_tutorial.8.t: "Liberal or Leftist Union"
ww1_italy_tutorial.8.d: "LIBERAL UNION:\n\nThe Liberal Union was a political alliance that unites centrists and liberals into a single coalition. This can be formed in-game with the completion of the focus 'Isolate the Extremist Parties'.\n\n\nLEFTIST UNION:\n\nThe Leftist Union can be formed with the completion of the focus 'Moderate the Extremist Parties'."

ww1_italy_tutorial.9.t: "How to Civil War?"
ww1_italy_tutorial.9.d: "To complete the socialist path, you must win a civil war. The requirements for triggering said civil war are located on the focus 'Arise, Workers of Italy!'. The easiest way of getting to the civil war is to lose the Libya War to provoke Red Week after an event chain. You can mishandle Red Week by having an inconsistent strategy."

ww1_italy_tutorial.10.t: "What are the Socialist Branches?"
ww1_italy_tutorial.10.d: "The Socialist path has many subpaths to chose from. You can prioritize the autonomists in the coalition in order to get an anarchist or syndicalist path. If you prioritize the Centralists, you have the power to go Maximalist, which can lead you to go fascist, or you can go less radical by establishing another parliament and reinstoring the return of democracy."

ww1_italy_tutorial.11.t: "The Libya Border Wars"
ww1_italy_tutorial.11.d: "[LBA.GetName] will unlock the same decisions as you to cause border conflicts. These border conflicts will allow either for you to kill the Senussi or for the Senussi to kick you our of the Sahara. We recommend using a stack of 6 of smaller size units to be less affected by the negative debuffs of supply you have as Italy."

ww1_italy_tutorial.12.t: "The Great War (Redux)"
ww1_italy_tutorial.12.d: "You can negotiate your entry on either side from the two negotiation focuses 'Negotiate with Britain' and 'Negotiate with Germany'. Both are event chains that ask for territory, equipment, promises and more. The War branch is unlocked when you are at war. Makes sense. \n\nThere are three numbers to watch out: 'Financial Budget', 'Food Supply', and 'Relationship with Labor'. If these get too negative, they will have debuffs to stability, war support and economy.\n "

ww1_italy_tutorial.13.t: "War Score"
ww1_italy_tutorial.13.d: "War Score is a variable representing our performance in the war. It is augmented by inflicting casualties, capturing enemy cities, and successful operations. It is decreased by taking casualties and losing core territory. The amount of war score dictates if we are worthy enough to our allies to obtain our promised territory."

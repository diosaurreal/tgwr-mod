## Characters ##
BUL_vasil_radoslavov_desc:0 "Born in Lovech, §YRadoslavov§! pursued his studies in law at Heidelberg, where he developed a keen interest in §qGerman§! culture and ideals. Politically active since 1884, he was successively appointed to a number of roles, including Minister of Justice (twice), Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Internal Affairs (twice), and Minister of National Enlightenment. \n\n§YRadoslavov§! holds the distinction of being the youngest person to have ever served as Prime Minister of Bulgaria at 32 years old. However, his tenure was marred by allegations of corruption, which ultimately led to his trial by the State Court on charges of high treason in 1903. Despite the eight-month imprisonment and debarment of civil and political rights that he received, he was granted amnesty by the Stambolovists."

Stancov was educated at the Theresianum in Vienna, where he studied business but, after graduation, drifted towards diplomatic work. Due to his education in the Habsburg Empire, the genesis of the Bulgarian nation and monarch, as well as his position in the bourgeoisie, Stanchov became a staunch and lifelong royalist. Stanchov eventually married a French noblewoman named Anna de Grenaud, Mistress of the Robes, and the marriage was announced by Ferdinand himself in 1899 at a royal ball. Stanchov would continue to build multiple strong relationships with influential members both professionally and personally; he served as an ambassador to Russia from 1896 to 1907, where he signed at the 1899 Hague peace conference, briefly served as the prime minister in 1907, and even built relationships with the Vatican. He now serves as a confidant to Ferdinand and an ambassador to Belgium and France."

ww1_bulgaria.66.t:0 "Achievement of San Stefano"

ww1_bulgaria.66.a:0 "Awesome!"
ww1_bulgaria.67.t:0 "Tobacco Surplus"
ww1_bulgaria.67.d:0 "Our bountiful tobacco harvest has led to a surplus, providing a boost to our economy and the well-being of our citizens."
ww1_bulgaria.67.a:0 "One of the many benefits of smoking!"
ww1_bulgaria.68.t:0 "Amending the Silver Constitution"
ww1_bulgaria.68.d:0 "Our country is being shifted in the position of the Tsar in a legal sense."
ww1_bulgaria.68.a:0 "Empower the Tsar!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.t:0 "Turkish Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.69.d:0 "The territories once held by the Ottoman Empire now stand under Bulgarian rule, yet the local Turkish population remains resistant. Tensions are rising, and it seems something must be done to address the opposition. Should we enforce harsher policies or attempt to offer autonomy to calm the region?"
ww1_bulgaria.69.a:0 "It's for their own good!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.b:0 "Perhaps an autonomous Thrace would be beneficial?"
ww1_bulgaria.70.t:0 "Greek Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.70.d:0 "The newly acquired territories that once belonged to Greece are proving troublesome. Greek nationals in these areas remain loyal to their homeland, refusing to fully integrate into Bulgaria. Their defiance might need to be quashed, or should we wait and hope their resistance will wane?"
ww1_bulgaria.70.a:0 "They'll Submit in Due Time"
ww1_bulgaria.71.t:0 "Ivan Geshov's Declaration on the Bulgarian Policy towards Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.71.d:0 "Ivan Geshov:\n'Our policy is sincere, and as we are anxious that it should not prove the ephemeral policy of our Cabinet, but should become the permanent policy of Bulgaria, we hope that the neighboring Empire will facilitate our task by responding to our invitation to eliminate the causes that are at the bottom of our misunderstandings and the motives that irritate public opinion in our country. In a parliamentary country, no government can march against public opinion. It will be a misfortune if our pacific policy fails under the pressure of public opinion, for whose excitement we are in no way responsible. Where we fail, it is hardly likely that any other Bulgarian government will succeed.'"
ww1_bulgaria.71.a:0 "Classic Pacifist Geshov"
ww1_bulgaria.72.t:0 "Ivan Geshov Comments on Relations with Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.72.d:0 "I have been asked by the Opposition to say on which side we are. My reply is that we are with those who sincerely wish for peace and who, as partisans of peace, favor those conditions without which peace cannot be maintained. These people think that the Balkan Peninsula ought to belong to the Balkan nations; they wish that whatever be the Balkan country where these nations live, they should enjoy the blessings of freedom, justice, and constitutional rights. We are with those who are friends of this sort of peace. If the Turks desire such a peace and can make peace such as we want it, then we are with the Turks also. Their neighbors for many centuries, connected with them by many economic ties, are anxious to live with them on friendly terms. We are the more anxious to pursue this policy because it is dictated to us by the vital interests of the Bulgarian nation in the kingdom and outside its frontiers. Nothing has happened thus far to shake our confidence in this policy or to undermine our hope that our neighbors also will realize their interest in observing the same friendly policy towards us. We hope that, taught by past and recent trials, from which we wish them to emerge successfully, they will understand the need to introduce in their European provinces conditions of life that will induce our nationalists to stay where they are, instead of flocking to our territory. The present emigration means misery to the Bulgarian nation and causes harm to the Turkish Empire. It is in the interest of both countries to arrest this emigration, which threatens Macedonia and Thrace with depopulation and inundates some of our frontiers with restless and embittered elements, thus creating a Macedonian problem in our own midst. If conditions of life are introduced that shall put an end to a state of things so pregnant with dangers; if our repeated proofs of peaceful intentions are met with deeds that would satisfy some legitimate demands on our part, we may be certain that a great step will have been made towards pacifying the provinces inhabited by our co-nationalists. And no one wishes more passionately for such a pacification than the sober and industrious Bulgarian nation, which, six weeks ago, met with such dignified calm the disquieting reports of a certain mobilization along our southern frontier."

Will the war be localized and short? \n2. Do they apprehend complications in Turkey as the result of fanatical excitement, chauvinistic passions, or a movement against the Young Turks, followed by a counterrevolution like that of April 1909? \n\nBoth affirmed that the war will be localized and short; however, their answers differed on the second question. M. de Selves believes that Italy will consent to pay an indemnity for Tripoli. She may also recognize the suzerainty of the Sultan, but about this he was not so positive. At all events, he believes that Italy will show herself very conciliatory if the Turks begin negotiations immediately after Tripoli is occupied. M. de Selves also sympathized with Geshov in his worries of Turkish aggression and proclaimed himself an admirer of the Tsar. Count Aehrental is of the opinion that the Young Turkish Committee constitutes the only organized force in Turkey, that it will gain rather than lose by the present crisis, and that it possesses power enough to impose its will."

ww1_bulgaria.75.d:0 "In 1908, Afiz Suleymanov was appointed to replace Ali Halil Mehmedov in the post of the Haskovo mufti. However, soon after his appointment, several accusations came up, such as corruption and mismanagement of several mosques. Afiz Suleymanov referred to the complaints in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion—he accused the former muftlik clerk Marko Avramov of fabricating these slanders after the dismissal. In his defense, Afiz Suleymanov pointed out that there was a signature of the former mufti Smail Hadji Halilov on the petition from March 1908, despite the fact that he did not read the Bulgarian language and could not have approved the complaint. The ministry decided that the mufti would keep his post. \n Afiz Suleymanov just recently won the 1910 Haskovo Mufti elections, and like clockwork, new accusations have emerged, which were linked to fraud during the appointing of the local mosque councillors. It was said that under the pressure of Afiz Suleymanov, the county (okoliya) authorities ignored the official results of the election and designated the old councillors. Among them, there was Akif Eminov, a close friend of the mufti, who was both his secretary and cashier..."

M. Stancioff, however, succeeded in impressing on Milovan Milovanovitch that the matter was extremely serious and deserved a fresh and careful examination by Serbia. The declaration of Mr. Stanchov startled Milovan Milovanovitch, who asked for an interview where they might again discuss the affair. Mr. Stanchov thereupon informed M. Milovanovitch that Dimitar Rizov had arrived from Rome for that very purpose and that it would be better if the exchange of ideas took place between the three, as Mr. Rizoff is exceptionally competent on all questions affecting Macedonia. Besides, such an exchange of ideas could form a continuation of the talks that Mr. Rizov had already had with Milovan Milovanovitch in Belgrade."

Dimitar Rizoff, in his turn, added that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor is equally indispensable to both governments, as a screen against public opinion in their countries, which are in direct opposition and not easy to reconcile on this question. The arbitration must bear both on the principle at stake and on its practical application."

Secondly, the belief that the river Ptchina is too small for a frontier line and that a watershed should be used instead. Thirdly, the fact that the villages in Preshovo have for a long time been Serbian, and it would be unfair if they were to remain on the Bulgarian side.

The secret annex dictated that in an upcoming war with the Turks, Bulgaria is entitled to the Valiyets of Monastir and Adrianople, while Serbia is entitled to the Vilyet of Kosovo and Scutari (Albania). Their assumption that war is inevitable is quite rash, and the Bulgarian thirst for Thrace is equally concerning... however, if necessary, we will supply the Bulgarian Army and secure them a loan."

The Emperor warmly welcomed the diplomats and expressed gratitude towards our understanding with the Serbs and Greeks and was even cheery about the secret annex; however, some other Russian officials were concerned and think that it's a rash and unnecessary action and that it wouldn't be profitable for Bulgaria. They also see our claims on Adrianople as futile, not only due to its exclusion from the Stan Stefano borders, but also according to them, the Turkish foothold in Thrace will be useless due to the fact that they've deteriorated so far into a second-class power. Russia did claim that if war was to come, they'd supply the Balkan armies, to an extent, and attempt to secure us loans..."

ww1_balkan_league.65.d:0 "Here recently we've become aware of negotiations taking place between Serbia and Bulgaria. About what exactly, it's unknown; however, it doesn't take a professor to piece together that the failure of the Young Turkish administration has left much to desire, and the Christian Balkan nations may be attempting to get rid of the Turkish foothold in Europe; Imperial Foreign Minister, Count Leopold Berchtold, has offered the idea of decentralization in the Turkish areas of Macedonia, Thrace, and Albania."
ww1_balkan_league.65.a:0 "Recommend this to the Balkan nations."
ww1_balkan_league.66.t:0 "The Austrian Proposal"
ww1_balkan_league.66.d:0 "Count Leopold Berchtold, imperial foreign minister of Austria, has made to us, Serbia, and Russia a suggestion that the Ottomans should decentralize their territory in Albania, Macedonia, and Thrace. To this preoccupation in Athens and Belgrade was added the anxiety caused by the Albanian claims on rightful Greek and Serbian districts, the Albanians openly demanding the entire vilayets of Uskub and Monastir. No such fears were entertained in Sofia as regards the Albanian danger, but in Bulgaria the massacre at Kotchani had produced even a deeper impression.\n\n What reason had we for being over-punctilious with an Empire already exhausted by the war with Italy, torn by internal feuds, with an undisciplined army and an empty treasury? \n\nHowever, the Count's proposal is not a bad basis for our demands."

The Supreme Macedonian Committee is a result of such political connections; the Supreme Committee is mostly made up of the Bulgarian Officer's Brotherhood and other extremists who favor terrorist acts and a war against the Ottoman Empire. We could utilize it and other Komitadji's to obtain the greater Bulgaria we so desire..."

Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held. The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for failing to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called for cavalry support, and after some mutual verbal insults, a fight broke out between the citizens and the military. The clashes resulted in 24 deaths and about 70 injuries. Initially, the police tried to cover up the story by restricting communications to and from Ruse, but it soon became top news in newspapers across the country."

## Characters ##
BUL_vasil_radoslavov_desc:0 "Born in Lovech, §YRadoslavov§! pursued his studies in law at Heidelberg, where he developed a keen interest in §qGerman§! culture and ideals. Politically active since 1884, he was successively appointed to a number of roles, including Minister of Justice (twice), Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Internal Affairs (twice), and Minister of National Enlightenment. \n\n§YRadoslavov§! holds the distinction of being the youngest person to have ever served as Prime Minister of Bulgaria at 32 years old. However, his tenure was marred by allegations of corruption, which ultimately led to his trial by the State Court on charges of high treason in 1903. Despite the eight-month imprisonment and debarment of civil and political rights that he received, he was granted amnesty by the Stambolovists."

BUL_dimitar_stancioff:0 "Dimitar Stanchov"
BUL_dimitar_stancioff:0 "Dimitar Stanchov was born to a wealthy family of merchants in Northern Bulgaria in 1863. Stancov was educated at the Theresianum in Vienna, where he studied business but, after graduation, drifted towards diplomatic work. Due to his education in the Habsburg Empire, the genesis of the Bulgarian nation and monarch, as well as his position in the bourgeoisie, Stanchov became a staunch and lifelong royalist. Stanchov eventually married a French noblewoman named Anna de Grenaud, Mistress of the Robes, and the marriage was announced by Ferdinand himself in 1899 at a royal ball. Stanchov would continue to build multiple strong relationships with influential members both professionally and personally; he served as an ambassador to Russia from 1896 to 1907, where he signed at the 1899 Hague peace conference, briefly served as the prime minister in 1907, and even built relationships with the Vatican. He now serves as a confidant to Ferdinand and an ambassador to Belgium and France."

Ferdinand I is a very flamboyant person, sometimes even described as feminine due to his attitude and manner, as well as the way he dresses. He is rumored to be bisexual. Due to Ferdinand's excellent charm he has been given the nickname of 'Foxy Ferdinand' and due to the many medals he adorns he was also nicknamed 'Christmas Tree', by his cousin, Emperor of Germany, Wilhelm II. Ferdinand has great ambitions, perhaps to great for his power... he wishes to unify all Bulgarians and make a New Byzantium; even as going as far as calling himself the 'Emperor of New Byzantium'. "

ww1_bulgaria.71.d:0 "Ivan Geshov:\n'Our policy is sincere, and as we are anxious that it should not prove the ephemeral policy of our Cabinet, but should become the permanent policy of Bulgaria, we hope that the neighboring Empire will facilitate our task by responding to our invitation to eliminate the causes that are at the bottom of our misunderstandings and the motives that irritate public opinion in our country. In a parliamentary country, no government can march against public opinion. It will be a misfortune if our pacific policy fails under the pressure of public opinion, for whose excitement we are in no way responsible. Where we fail, it is hardly likely that any other Bulgarian government will succeed.'"
ww1_bulgaria.71.a:0 "Classic Pacifist Geshov"
ww1_bulgaria.72.t:0 "Ivan Geshov Comments on Relations with Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.72.d:0 "I have been asked by the Opposition to say on which side we are. My reply is that we are with those who sincerely wish for peace and who, as partisans of peace, favor those conditions without which peace cannot be maintained. These people think that the Balkan Peninsula ought to belong to the Balkan nations; they wish that whatever be the Balkan country where these nations live, they should enjoy the blessings of freedom, justice, and constitutional rights. We are with those who are friends of this sort of peace. If the Turks desire such a peace and can make peace such as we want it, then we are with the Turks also. Their neighbors for many centuries, connected with them by many economic ties, are anxious to live with them on friendly terms. We are the more anxious to pursue this policy because it is dictated to us by the vital interests of the Bulgarian nation in the kingdom and outside its frontiers. Nothing has happened thus far to shake our confidence in this policy or to undermine our hope that our neighbors also will realize their interest in observing the same friendly policy towards us. We hope that, taught by past and recent trials, from which we wish them to emerge successfully, they will understand the need to introduce in their European provinces conditions of life that will induce our nationalists to stay where they are, instead of flocking to our territory. The present emigration means misery to the Bulgarian nation and causes harm to the Turkish Empire. It is in the interest of both countries to arrest this emigration, which threatens Macedonia and Thrace with depopulation and inundates some of our frontiers with restless and embittered elements, thus creating a Macedonian problem in our own midst. If conditions of life are introduced that shall put an end to a state of things so pregnant with dangers; if our repeated proofs of peaceful intentions are met with deeds that would satisfy some legitimate demands on our part, we may be certain that a great step will have been made towards pacifying the provinces inhabited by our co-nationalists. And no one wishes more passionately for such a pacification than the sober and industrious Bulgarian nation, which, six weeks ago, met with such dignified calm the disquieting reports of a certain mobilization along our southern frontier."

ww1_bulgaria.74.d:0 "Ivan Geshov, while in the respective cities, talked to M. de Selves in France and Count Aehrental in Austria. Geshov asked both the same two questions:1. Will the war be localized and short? \n2. Do they apprehend complications in Turkey as the result of fanatical excitement, chauvinistic passions, or a movement against the Young Turks, followed by a counterrevolution like that of April 1909? \n\nBoth affirmed that the war will be localized and short; however, their answers differed on the second question. M. de Selves believes that Italy will consent to pay an indemnity for Tripoli. She may also recognize the suzerainty of the Sultan, but about this he was not so positive. At all events, he believes that Italy will show herself very conciliatory if the Turks begin negotiations immediately after Tripoli is occupied. M. de Selves also sympathized with Geshov in his worries of Turkish aggression and proclaimed himself an admirer of the Tsar. Count Aehrental is of the opinion that the Young Turkish Committee constitutes the only organized force in Turkey, that it will gain rather than lose by the present crisis, and that it possesses power enough to impose its will."

ww1_bulgaria.75.d:0 "In 1908, Afiz Suleymanov was appointed to replace Ali Halil Mehmedov in the post of the Haskovo mufti. However, soon after his appointment, several accusations came up, such as corruption and mismanagement of several mosques. Afiz Suleymanov referred to the complaints in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion—he accused the former muftlik clerk Marko Avramov of fabricating these slanders after the dismissal. In his defense, Afiz Suleymanov pointed out that there was a signature of the former mufti Smail Hadji Halilov on the petition from March 1908, despite the fact that he did not read the Bulgarian language and could not have approved the complaint. The ministry decided that the mufti would keep his post. \n Afiz Suleymanov just recently won the 1910 Haskovo Mufti elections, and like clockwork, new accusations have emerged, which were linked to fraud during the appointing of the local mosque councillors. It was said that under the pressure of Afiz Suleymanov, the county (okoliya) authorities ignored the official results of the election and designated the old councillors. Among them, there was Akif Eminov, a close friend of the mufti, who was both his secretary and cashier..."

This will not only boost Porto-Bulgarian relations but also help cement our place in the world. Due to Portugal's strategic location and colonies, we could also develop a very good route to the Atlantic, and besides, us monarchies need to stick together in the age of revolution and reform."
ww1_bulgaria.76.a:0 "Toast to our Portuguese Friends"
ww1_bulgaria.77.t:0 "Signing a Treaty of Trade & Navigation with Portugal"
ww1_bulgaria.77.d:0 "Recently our diplomats traveled to Lisbon to make contact with the new republic. They received a warm welcome even in the chaotic state of turbulence Portugal is in. They talked about many things, but most importantly, we officially recognized the new government, and we were able to set the treaty of trade & navigation. This will not only boost Porto-Bulgarian relations but also help cement our place in the world.

The VMORO has chosen to turn away from traditional uprisings and levitate towards terror attacks. They used Donkey's to bomb Macedonian villages. November 21, 1911, a partisan disguised as a Bulgarian peasant planted a bomb on a Donkey and attempted to guide the donkey towards an Ottoman government building and continued on until the bomb went off infront of a Mosque. Just recently  another 'Donkey Attack' has taken place; this time on July 19, 1912 in Kochani. The explosion killed 24 people mostly Bulgarians. Minutes later, a second explosion followed, in which no one was injured. These explosions unleashed a real bloodbath that lasted 7 hours, after Ottoman regular troops and irregulars entered the city."

These suspicions have been intensified by the perusal of official documents like the report of the Bulgarian Consul at Monastir, according to which Dr. Nazim Bey, the ideologist of the Young Turkish party, had promised to the notables at Vodena, in a speech overheard by M. Wigand, engineer on the Salonica-Monastir railway line, that if the Young Turks were supported at the coming elections, there would be no Christians left in Macedonia in 30-40 years.

M. Stancioff, however, succeeded in impressing on Milovan Milovanovitch that the matter was extremely serious and deserved a fresh and careful examination by Serbia. The declaration of Mr. Stanchov startled Milovan Milovanovitch, who asked for an interview where they might again discuss the affair. Mr. Stanchov thereupon informed M. Milovanovitch that Dimitar Rizov had arrived from Rome for that very purpose and that it would be better if the exchange of ideas took place between the three, as Mr. Rizoff is exceptionally competent on all questions affecting Macedonia. Besides, such an exchange of ideas could form a continuation of the talks that Mr. Rizov had already had with Milovan Milovanovitch in Belgrade."

ww1_balkan_league.20.d:0 "Still in Paris, Dimitar Stanchov opened the conversation with:\n\nThe original Serbo-Bulgarian conversation on the subject of the understanding, for which the two countries are equally anxious, laid down that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor will bear on the following geographical boundary, which represented the utmost concession on the Bulgarian side; the river Ptchina as the frontier to the east of Vardar; the southern boundaries of the sandjaks of Uskub and Prizrend as the frontier to the west of Vardar, on condition that recourse will be had to partition only after events had established that Macedonian autonomy is either impossible or cannot last long.\n\nThe proposals Serbia has brought from Belgrade, on the contrary, reject the principle of autonomy and lay down that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor shall bear on a new geographical frontier of the Serbian claims in Macedonia, running to the east of Vardar along the river Bregalnitza and to the west of Vardar along a line corresponding to it, reaching Lake Ochrida near Strouga.\n\nFurther, Stanchov added that there could be no question about any concessions ab initio and that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor ought to be obligatory. Dimitar Rizoff, in his turn, added that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor is equally indispensable to both governments, as a screen against public opinion in their countries, which are in direct opposition and not easy to reconcile on this question. The arbitration must bear both on the principle at stake and on its practical application."

ww1_balkan_league.21.d:0 "Milovan Milovanovitch replied that the modifications formerly proposed were inspired by the following motives:\n\nFirstly, the natural presumption is that the Russian Emperor will adopt neither the Bulgarian nor the Serbian standpoint but will seek an intermediate position between the Bulgarian concessions and the Serbian claims in Macedonia so that neither the Serbian line of demarcation nor the Bulgarian line will be the one finally adopted. Secondly, the belief that the river Ptchina is too small for a frontier line and that a watershed should be used instead. Thirdly, the fact that the villages in Preshovo have for a long time been Serbian, and it would be unfair if they were to remain on the Bulgarian side. Fourthly, the conviction that the Serbians had already made very significant concessions."

You have more than once told me that the first and most important object of the Serbian foreign policy ought to be an understanding with Bulgaria. If you are convinced of this, you must attain that object even at the risk of exposing yourself to the temporary abuse of your short-sighted compatriots.

The Emperor warmly welcomed the diplomats and expressed gratitude towards our understanding with the Serbs and Greeks and was even cheery about the secret annex; however, some other Russian officials were concerned and think that it's a rash and unnecessary action and that it wouldn't be profitable for Bulgaria. They also see our claims on Adrianople as futile, not only due to its exclusion from the Stan Stefano borders, but also according to them, the Turkish foothold in Thrace will be useless due to the fact that they've deteriorated so far into a second-class power. Russia did claim that if war was to come, they'd supply the Balkan armies, to an extent, and attempt to secure us loans..."

To this preoccupation in Athens and Belgrade was added the anxiety caused by the Albanian claims on rightful Greek and Serbian districts, the Albanians openly demanding the entire vilayets of Uskub and Monastir. No such fears were entertained in Sofia as regards the Albanian danger, but in Bulgaria the massacre at Kotchani had produced even a deeper impression.\n\n What reason had we for being over-punctilious with an Empire already exhausted by the war with Italy, torn by internal feuds, with an undisciplined army and an empty treasury? \n\nHowever, the Count's proposal is not a bad basis for our demands."

Constantinople reached out to the League to discuss an armistice, and the League so kindly agreed. Negotiations are to take place with the London Conference, which is hosted by the Great Powers.

The general has been a collaborator of the Bulgarian movement for a while; in 1907, Andranik settled in Sofia, where he met the leaders of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, including revolutionary Boris Sarafov—and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia."

During negotiations, the Ottoman Empire attempted to contest the large demands of the Balkan League; however, they could do little in their current position. The conference did prove that the Balkan League & the Ottomans at least had a chance to cooperate, and perhaps peace could've been made, but to everyone's shock, there was a coup in Constantinople, and the new government has canceled negotiations and vowed to continue the war..."

ww1_balkan_wars.32.t:0 "Incident At The Border"
ww1_balkan_wars.32.d:0 "Yesterday morning, 8 am. The Bulgarian high command demanded that battalions located in Strumica move westward towards the Serbian border to supply the local garrison, as records of conflict between the local Serbian population and newly recruited and stationed Bulgarian forces were received, their mission was to pull the local garrisons a kilometer away from the Serbian border for the time being to end tensions.\n4 battalions arrived by early afternoon where a Lieutenant Colonel was chosen among them to organize the entire force in the region; however, the chosen Lieutenant had a name eerily similar to another, which caused a verbal argument between the 2. Later the same day, one of the 2 Lieutenants -who was later revealed to be the correct one to take charge- was out drinking outside their military outpost due to lingering stress from the earlier argument. Lieutenant heard a gunshot that startled him -later revealed to be a misfire of a young cadet in the outpost- which made him anxious. Lieutenant ordered a group of 20 troops to scout the area to find the supposed enemy.\nAt 9pm, the 20-man strong scout force saw the silhouette of close to 10 men, with 9 of them seemingly carrying military equipment and rifles. Bulgarian forces, seemingly anxious due to the angry outburst of their Lieutenant that sent them on the mission, carefully closed the distance to determine the threat. However, when one of the forces across the hill made a sudden move, one of the Bulgarian forces shot out of instinct, which then started a small skirmish between the 2 sides that led to the death of 3 that later revealed to be Serbian forces.\nIt was found out today that the Serbian forces crossed the Bulgarian border unknowingly to help a wealthy shepherd find some of his lost cattle in exchange for bribes. The Serbian High Command demanded an apology for the shoot-out, but the Bulgarian High Command instead demanded an apology of their own due to the Serbian incursion into their border. The failure of cool-headness, coupled with the tensions between 2 sides due to ambitions in Macedonia, unfortunately led to 3 small-scale border skirmishes across the Macedonian border. And now, ---- has declared war over ----. It seems like the Balkan Peninsula is yet to see peace."

ww1_balkan_wars.33.d:0 "As the tensions are so thick that they could be cut with a butter knife in the Balkans! In order to gain a better position in the many negotiations surrounding our spoils of wars, Tsar Ferdinand ordered an attack the 4th and 2nd armies attacked the Serbian and Greek troops on a broad front from the Osogovo Mountains to the Orphan Bay. In the chaos it's not clear how harsh the intentions of the Tsar were or whether Prime Minister Danev was aware of this plan! Mihail Savov ordered a ceasefire but his orders were ignored and Bulgarian diplomats are not being accepted by Greece nor Serbia!"

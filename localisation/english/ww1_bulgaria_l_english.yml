BUL_vasil_radoslavov_desc: "Born in Lovech, §YRadoslavov§! pursued his studies in law at Heidelberg, where he developed a keen interest in §qGerman§! culture and ideals. Politically active since 1884, he was successively appointed to a number of roles, including Minister of Justice (twice), Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Internal Affairs (twice), and Minister of National Enlightenment. \n\n§YRadoslavov§! holds the distinction of being the youngest person to have ever served as Prime Minister of Bulgaria at 32 years old. However, his tenure was marred by allegations of corruption, which ultimately led to his trial by the State Court on charges of high treason in 1903.

BUL_dimitar_stancioff: "Dimitar Stanchov was born to a wealthy family of merchants in Northern Bulgaria in 1863. Stancov was educated at the Theresianum in Vienna, where he studied business but, after graduation, drifted towards diplomatic work. Due to his education in the Habsburg Empire, the genesis of the Bulgarian nation and monarch, as well as his position in the bourgeoisie, Stanchov became a staunch and lifelong royalist. Stanchov eventually married a French noblewoman named Anna de Grenaud, Mistress of the Robes, and the marriage was announced by Ferdinand himself in 1899 at a royal ball. Stanchov would continue to build multiple strong relationships with influential members both professionally and personally; he served as an ambassador to Russia from 1896 to 1907, where he signed at the 1899 Hague peace conference, briefly served as the prime minister in 1907, and even built relationships with the Vatican. He now serves as a confidant to Ferdinand and an ambassador to Belgium and France."

ww1_bulgaria.66.t: "Achievement of San Stefano"
ww1_bulgaria.66.d: "Through hard work and perseverance, we have regained control over the territories that once belonged to the Bulgarian state. This is a significant milestone in our history."
ww1_bulgaria.66.a: "Awesome!"
ww1_bulgaria.67.t: "Tobacco Surplus"
ww1_bulgaria.67.d: "Our bountiful tobacco harvest has led to a surplus, providing a boost to our economy and the well-being of our citizens."
ww1_bulgaria.67.a: "One of the many benefits of smoking!"
ww1_bulgaria.68.t: "Amending the Silver Constitution"
ww1_bulgaria.68.d: "Our country is being shifted in the position of the Tsar in a legal sense."
ww1_bulgaria.68.a: "Empower the Tsar!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.t: "Turkish Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.69.d: "The territories once held by the Ottoman Empire now stand under Bulgarian rule, yet the local Turkish population remains resistant. Tensions are rising, and it seems something must be done to address the opposition. Should we enforce harsher policies or attempt to offer autonomy to calm the region?"
ww1_bulgaria.69.a: "It's for their own good!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.b: "Perhaps an autonomous Thrace would be beneficial?"
ww1_bulgaria.70.t: "Greek Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.70.d: "The newly acquired territories that once belonged to Greece are proving troublesome. Greek nationals in these areas remain loyal to their homeland, refusing to fully integrate into Bulgaria. Their defiance might need to be quashed, or should we wait and hope their resistance will wane?"
ww1_bulgaria.70.a: "They'll Submit in Due Time"
ww1_bulgaria.71.t: "Ivan Geshov's Declaration on the Bulgarian Policy towards Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.71.d: "Ivan Geshov:\n'Our policy is sincere, and as we are anxious that it should not prove the ephemeral policy of our Cabinet, but should become the permanent policy of Bulgaria, we hope that the neighboring Empire will facilitate our task by responding to our invitation to eliminate the causes that are at the bottom of our misunderstandings and the motives that irritate public opinion in our country. In a parliamentary country, no government can march against public opinion. It will be a misfortune if our pacific policy fails under the pressure of public opinion, for whose excitement we are in no way responsible. Where we fail, it is hardly likely that any other Bulgarian government will succeed.'"
ww1_bulgaria.71.a: "Classic Pacifist Geshov"
ww1_bulgaria.72.t: "Ivan Geshov Comments on Relations with Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.72.d: "I have been asked by the Opposition to say on which side we are. My reply is that we are with those who sincerely wish for peace and who, as partisans of peace, favor those conditions without which peace cannot be maintained. These people think that the Balkan Peninsula ought to belong to the Balkan nations; they wish that whatever be the Balkan country where these nations live, they should enjoy the blessings of freedom, justice, and constitutional rights. We are with those who are friends of this sort of peace. If the Turks desire such a peace and can make peace such as we want it, then we are with the Turks also. Their neighbors for many centuries, connected with them by many economic ties, are anxious to live with them on friendly terms. We are the more anxious to pursue this policy because it is dictated to us by the vital interests of the Bulgarian nation in the kingdom and outside its frontiers. Nothing has happened thus far to shake our confidence in this policy or to undermine our hope that our neighbors also will realize their interest in observing the same friendly policy towards us. We hope that, taught by past and recent trials, from which we wish them to emerge successfully, they will understand the need to introduce in their European provinces conditions of life that will induce our nationalists to stay where they are, instead of flocking to our territory. The present emigration means misery to the Bulgarian nation and causes harm to the Turkish Empire. It is in the interest of both countries to arrest this emigration, which threatens Macedonia and Thrace with depopulation and inundates some of our frontiers with restless and embittered elements, thus creating a Macedonian problem in our own midst. If conditions of life are introduced that shall put an end to a state of things so pregnant with dangers; if our repeated proofs of peaceful intentions are met with deeds that would satisfy some legitimate demands on our part, we may be certain that a great step will have been made towards pacifying the provinces inhabited by our co-nationalists. And no one wishes more passionately for such a pacification than the sober and industrious Bulgarian nation, which, six weeks ago, met with such dignified calm the disquieting reports of a certain mobilization along our southern frontier."
ww1_bulgaria.72.a: "Can Peace Reform the Balkans?"
ww1_bulgaria.73.t: "Bulgarian Consul-General in Salonica, M. Shopoff's Report"
ww1_bulgaria.73.d: "We have already lost one-fourth of what we had fifteen years ago. This is no idle concern; the Turkish ideology of 'Ottomanization' is a threat to the integrity of all South Slavs—especially Bulgarians."
ww1_bulgaria.73.a: "Concerning Indeed..."
ww1_bulgaria.74.t: "Ivan Geshov Urgently Visits Vienna and Paris in Regards to the Italian Invasion of Libya"
ww1_bulgaria.74.d: "Ivan Geshov, while in the respective cities, talked to M. de Selves in France and Count Aehrental in Austria. Geshov asked both the same two questions:1. Will the war be localized and short? \n2. Do they apprehend complications in Turkey as the result of fanatical excitement, chauvinistic passions, or a movement against the Young Turks, followed by a counterrevolution like that of April 1909? \n\nBoth affirmed that the war will be localized and short; however, their answers differed on the second question. M. de Selves believes that Italy will consent to pay an indemnity for Tripoli. She may also recognize the suzerainty of the Sultan, but about this he was not so positive. At all events, he believes that Italy will show herself very conciliatory if the Turks begin negotiations immediately after Tripoli is occupied. M. de Selves also sympathized with Geshov in his worries of Turkish aggression and proclaimed himself an admirer of the Tsar. Count Aehrental is of the opinion that the Young Turkish Committee constitutes the only organized force in Turkey, that it will gain rather than lose by the present crisis, and that it possesses power enough to impose its will."
ww1_bulgaria.74.a: "Let's Hope The War is a Swift One"
ww1_bulgaria.75.t: "The case of Mufti Afiz Suleymanov"
ww1_bulgaria.75.d: "In 1908, Afiz Suleymanov was appointed to replace Ali Halil Mehmedov in the post of the Haskovo mufti. However, soon after his appointment, several accusations came up, such as corruption and mismanagement of several mosques. Afiz Suleymanov referred to the complaints in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion—he accused the former muftlik clerk Marko Avramov of fabricating these slanders after the dismissal.

The ministry decided that the mufti would keep his post. \n Afiz Suleymanov just recently won the 1910 Haskovo Mufti elections, and like clockwork, new accusations have emerged, which were linked to fraud during the appointing of the local mosque councillors. It was said that under the pressure of Afiz Suleymanov, the county (okoliya) authorities ignored the official results of the election and designated the old councillors.

ww1_BUL_TUR.68.d: "Ivan Geshov, since January of 1910, has been pushing for us to renew the trade agreement. We make up a third of Bulgarian exports and most of Bulgarian imports; if we strengthen our trade relations, we could economically coerce them into our influence... Oh, and it would improve the living standards of Thrace and Macedonia, but who cares about them?"
ww1_BUL_TUR.69.t: "Grand Mufti Elections"
ww1_BUL_TUR.69.d: "The Grand Mufti is the highest religious authority within Sunni Islam in a given country or region, overseeing Islamic legal and theological matters. Due to our high Muslim population, this is a very important election, now even more emphasized by the Ottoman Empire's wishes to see Suleyman Rusdi, the current mufti of Vividin, come to power. They fear that if Hocazade Mehmet Muhiddin Efendi continues his reign in just a few decades, all Muslims in Thrace and Macedonia will cease to exist."

ww1_BUL_TUR.75.t: "Negotiations Delapitated"
ww1_BUL_TUR.75.d: "To both parties dismay, the continuation of tragedies in both Macedonia and Thrace, growing public opinions, and contrary practices have led to negotiations falling apart and the Bulgarian-Ottoman honeymoon phase ending."
ww1_BUL_TUR.75.a: "What Does the Future Hold for the Balkans?"
ww1_BUL_TUR.76.a: "Continuation of Massacres in Macedonia and Thrace"
ww1_BUL_TUR.76.d: "The frontier incidents that exasperated public opinion in Bulgaria became more frequent, while massacres like those at Shtip and Kotchani, murders, pillaging, tortures, and persecutions, and the systematic ill-treatment of the Bulgarians in the Turkish army so increased the number of refugees from Macedonia and Thrace that the most peaceful Bulgarian statesmen are aroused and have begun to ask themselves if all this was not the result of a deliberate plan on the part of the Young Turks to solve the Macedonian and Thracian problem by clearing those two provinces of their Bulgarian and Christian inhabitants. These suspicions have been intensified by the perusal of official documents like the report of the Bulgarian Consul at Monastir, according to which Dr. Nazim Bey, the ideologist of the Young Turkish party, had promised to the notables at Vodena, in a speech overheard by M. Wigand, engineer on the Salonica-Monastir railway line, that if the Young Turks were supported at the coming elections, there would be no Christians left in Macedonia in 30-40 years. Those who were acquainted with the rapid decrease of the Bulgarian population in Macedonia during the first decade of the present century knew that this is no idle threat."

ww1_BUL_TUR.77.d: "Due to the recent birth of the Bulgarian Tsardom, many Ottoman citizens continue to reside in Bulgaria, specifically Eastern Rumelia. After our requests for them to cease such egregious activities, they still continue!"
ww1_BUL_TUR.77.a: "What can we even do?"
ww1_BUL_TUR.78.t: "Fallout between us & Bulgaria"
ww1_BUL_TUR.78.d: "Our recent negotiations have failed, mostly due to Bulgaria expecting significant concessions with nothing for us to benefit. They openly opposed us at every angle. It's no secret that they only came to us for an autonomous Macedonian-Thracian state, not out of good faith. With us not appeasing the Tsar with autonomous territories, the only option they are left with would be war... it'd be wise to ward off the Slavic menaces..."
ww1_BUL_TUR.78.a: "Mobilize the army!"
ww1_BUL_TUR.79.t: "Ottoman Mobilization"
ww1_BUL_TUR.79.d: "Our recent negotiations with the Turks have obviously not been fruitful, unsurprising to some... Either way, with the continued killing of Slavs in Macedonia & Thrace, we cannot sit idle, leaving many to ponder an invasion. The Turks are not blind and preemptively mobilized their army in Macedonia and Thrace! Will they invade? Some even fear a joint Turkish-Gypsy invasion!"

M. Rizov told Geshov about his discussions in Belgrade with the Serbian prime minister; they went well. Geshov and Rizov then drafted a memorandum that should outline the coming negotiations and renewal of the 1904 treaty. \n 1. The renewal of the treaty of 1904, mutatis mutandis; instead of reforms, we shall ask for autonomy; if that should prove impossible, we shall divide Macedonia. \n 2.

They were amazed at the modifications that Serbia proposed to introduce into that agreement by rejecting all principles of Macedonian autonomy and by altering the geographical boundary of her Macedonian claims. She substitutes the river of Bregalnitza for that of Ptchina as her frontier to the east of Vardar, reserving for herself the town of Veles, with the corresponding line to the west of Vardar, including the towns of Prilep, Kroushevo, Kitchevo, and Strouga, in lieu of the present boundaries of the sandjaks of Uskub and Prizrend.

The declaration of Mr. Stanchov startled Milovan Milovanovitch, who asked for an interview where they might again discuss the affair. Mr. Stanchov thereupon informed M. Milovanovitch that Dimitar Rizov had arrived from Rome for that very purpose and that it would be better if the exchange of ideas took place between the three, as Mr. Rizoff is exceptionally competent on all questions affecting Macedonia.

Dimitar Rizoff, in his turn, added that the arbitration of the Russian Emperor is equally indispensable to both governments, as a screen against public opinion in their countries, which are in direct opposition and not easy to reconcile on this question. The arbitration must bear both on the principle at stake and on its practical application."

ww1_balkan_league.21.d: "Milovan Milovanovitch replied that the modifications formerly proposed were inspired by the following motives:\n\nFirstly, the natural presumption is that the Russian Emperor will adopt neither the Bulgarian nor the Serbian standpoint but will seek an intermediate position between the Bulgarian concessions and the Serbian claims in Macedonia so that neither the Serbian line of demarcation nor the Bulgarian line will be the one finally adopted. Secondly, the belief that the river Ptchina is too small for a frontier line and that a watershed should be used instead. Thirdly, the fact that the villages in Preshovo have for a long time been Serbian, and it would be unfair if they were to remain on the Bulgarian side. Fourthly, the conviction that the Serbians had already made very significant concessions."

They have also agreed that all of Macedonia is to be autonomous. We find these claims very welcoming, especially due to the fact that on the train, Milovan Milovanovitch seemed reluctant to agree to an autonomous Macedonia."

You will, therefore, believe in my absolute sincerity and frankness on this occasion. Well, I assure you on my honor and in the name of my country that this is our last effort to arrive at such an understanding and that Serbia will never again find a Bulgarian government so well disposed and willing to conclude an agreement. I need hardly tell you that no Bulgarian government will venture, even if it feels disposed, to conclude with Serbia an understanding that does not provide for Macedonian autonomy. If you, Milovan Milovanovitch, agree with all this, you must realize what a terrible responsibility you are assuming before your own people and before the entire Slav world should our present initiative meet with failure. You know as well as anybody that we must not waste time, or events might anticipate us. As your old friend, I implore you to associate your name with this great enterprise. Have the courage to surmount the obstacles in the way, even when they come from your political friends. That is how great deeds in this world are done. You have more than once told me that the first and most important object of the Serbian foreign policy ought to be an understanding with Bulgaria. If you are convinced of this, you must attain that object even at the risk of exposing yourself to the temporary abuse of your short-sighted compatriots. Bear in mind, Mr. Milovanovitch, that this is the last opportunity for concluding the Serbo-Bulgarian agreement on behalf of which we have both so much pleaded, and that no such opportunity will recur again. As these words were being uttered, Mr. Stanchov returned, and realizing the purport of the conversation, dealt Mr. Milovanovitch the final coup de grace by adding, Do not forget that the entire responsibility before the Macedonian public opinion for the territorial concessions that we are making to you in Macedonia has been placed on Mr. Rizov, both by the Bulgarian Tsar and by the Bulgarian Government.'\n\n All this impressed Mr. Milovanovitch so much that he could find nothing to reply, merely contenting himself with the words that he still remained convinced, more so than ever before, of the paramount importance for Serbia of arriving at an understanding with Bulgaria. \n\nFollowing this, the group left Paris."

Particularly the Old Radicals are against Milovanovitch's terms and want a treaty that grants Serbia more of Macedonia... In fact, several members have made it clear that they do not intend to respect the treaties... Despite this, Milovan Milovanovitch has formulated the proposal for the Province of Skopje to be the contested territory meant to be dictated by Russian arbitration...

As of now, Bulgaria is to receive Thrace, Adrianople, and Central & East Macedonia, while Serbia is to receive Kosovo, Novi Pazar, and Albania...

The secret annex dictated that in an upcoming war with the Turks, Bulgaria is entitled to the Valiyets of Monastir and Adrianople, while Serbia is entitled to the Vilyet of Kosovo and Scutari (Albania).

They also see our claims on Adrianople as futile, not only due to its exclusion from the Stan Stefano borders, but also according to them, the Turkish foothold in Thrace will be useless due to the fact that they've deteriorated so far into a second-class power.

To this preoccupation in Athens and Belgrade was added the anxiety caused by the Albanian claims on rightful Greek and Serbian districts, the Albanians openly demanding the entire vilayets of Uskub and Monastir. No such fears were entertained in Sofia as regards the Albanian danger, but in Bulgaria the massacre at Kotchani had produced even a deeper impression.\n\n What reason had we for being over-punctilious with an Empire already exhausted by the war with Italy, torn by internal feuds, with an undisciplined army and an empty treasury? \n\nHowever, the Count's proposal is not a bad basis for our demands."

ww1_balkan_wars.2.t: "An Armistice Requested by the Ottomans"
ww1_balkan_wars.2.d: "Following the Ottoman army's rapid collapse against our League's forces and the tragic extermination of Thracian Muslims, Ottoman delegates would like to discuss an armistice to arbitrate our differences in the Balkans via the Great Powers..."

ww1_balkan_wars.3.a: "Are We Even An Empire Anymore?"
ww1_balkan_wars.4.t: "Armistice in The Balkans!"
ww1_balkan_wars.4.d: "Following the disastrous conflict that has engulfed the Balkan Peninsula, the Ottoman Army experienced a series of failures on the front lines, on the sea, and even with new airplane technology in the air. ... Constantinople reached out to the League to discuss an armistice, and the League so kindly agreed. Negotiations are to take place with the London Conference, which is hosted by the Great Powers. It is also to be noted that Greece has declined an armistice, for they're dissatisfied with their gains..."

ww1_balkan_wars.5.t: "Armenian Volunteers!"
ww1_balkan_wars.5.d: "As our Christian crusade unleashes against the tyrannical Ottoman Turks, it has inspired a movement of Armenian volunteers to join the arms of the Bulgarian Army, headed by General Andranik Ozanian. The general has been a collaborator of the Bulgarian movement for a while; in 1907, Andranik settled in Sofia, where he met the leaders of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, including revolutionary Boris Sarafov—and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia."

During negotiations, the Ottoman Empire attempted to contest the large demands of the Balkan League; however, they could do little at their current position. The conference did prove that the Balkan League & the Ottomans at least had a chance to cooperate, and perhaps peace could've been made, but to everyone's shock, there was a coup in Constantinople, and the new government has canceled negotiations and vowed to continue the war..."

ww1_balkan_wars.6.c: "Is This Even A Surprise?"
ww1_balkan_wars.7.t: "Setting Up Another Armistice with Bulgaria..."
ww1_balkan_wars.7.d: "Following our continuation of the conflict, it has become quite obvious that the war effort is not to our advantage; in fact, quite the opposite, especially combined with the cholera outbreaks at the front line. With Bulgaria knocking at the gates of Catalca and threatening Constantinople, our hand is forced; we must attempt to reach another armistice..."
ww1_balkan_wars.7.a: "Maybe we just suck?"
ww1_balkan_wars.8.t: "The Ottomans Request Another Armistice"
ww1_balkans_wars.8.d: "After the Ottoman Turks made the foolish decision to continue the war following the first armistice, they have come to realize that they simply have no chance at turning the tides of the war, and like the beggars they are, they are peddling for another armistice..."

ww1_balkan_wars.8.b: "They had one shot and blew it!"
ww1_balkan_wars.9.t: "Cholera Outbreaks!"
ww1_balkan_wars.9.d: "As our army advances into Adrianople on the road towards Catacla and Constantinople, our army is experiencing a cholera outbreak from the muddy and unsanitary conditions of the frontlines; no doubt this was caused by the filthy Turks!"

ww1_balkan_wars.10.a: "Put Them Down!"
ww1_balkan_wars.11.t: "The Battle of Catacla!"
ww1_balkan_wars.11.d: "Despite the formidable fortifications and the ravages of disease, our commanders urge us to push onward with the Çatalca Offensive. The enemy is deeply entrenched, with artillery emplacements and defensive lines that have already repelled numerous assaults. To make matters worse, a cholera outbreak is spreading through the ranks, sapping morale and weakening our fighting strength. Yet, the prospect of withdrawing is unthinkable—onwards!"

BUL_ruse_blood_wedding_ordeal_3_desc: "On February 24, 1910, Yordan Stefanov and Saafet received permission to marry from a doctor, as Saafet was deemed “mentally healthy” and claimed to be 18 years old. Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held. The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for failing to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called for cavalry support, and after some mutual verbal insults, a fight broke out between the citizens and the military. The clashes resulted in 24 deaths and about 70 injuries. Initially, the police tried to cover up the story by restricting communications to and from Ruse, but it soon became top news in newspapers across the country."
BUL_peasantry_desc: "In the rural heartlands of Bulgaria, it is the peasantry, more specifically the cystic ‘peasantry,’ which remains the mainstay of the nation through times of economic repugnance and political upheaval. Deeply rooted in culture and more inclination to its soil, these diligent people contribute to the national food production. It is true that there is backwardness in terms of infrastructure development and technology. However, it is this will power that is most likely going to be the building block for the future of Bulgaria."

Those the tensions between our two biggest patrons have largely cooled, our main political parties, otherwise mostly in agreement on their internal policy, are still split between East and West. If we wish to keep our cordial relations with the Great Powers, we must be very weary of our government's actions, lest we alienate either side."
BUL_idea_anti_greek_attitude: "Anti-Greek Attitude"
BUL_idea_anti_greek_attitude_desc: "Ever since the anti-Greek pogroms of 1906 following the appointment of Neophitos of Varna which saw 8 dead and thousands homeless and with the increased Macedonian migration to the Black sea coast, the Bulgarian state has had to deal with anti-Greek violence more and more often, straining our relations with Greece and putting pressure on our police force in Burgas and Varna."

An Ottoman defeat would be to Russia's delight, but to Austria's agony. Greek, Serbian & montenegrin expansion into the Adriatic will offend Italy & Austria, while Bulgarian expansion into Thrace will urk the Russian claims on Constantinople, and let's not forget the obliteration of a possible Albanian state with the chaos... It'd be most wise to invite the other Great Powers to discuss this, like the gentleman we are."

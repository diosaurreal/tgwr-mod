 ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
 ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály Károlyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to form a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. However, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.\n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the assasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."
 ww1_hungary.10.a: "End of an Era!"
 ww1_hungary.11.t: "Disaster At Lemberg"
 ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While Alfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on to. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."
 ww1_hungary.11.a: "We have to point the finger at someone"

 ww1_hun_revolution.1.b: "Not a bad idea.."
 ww1_hun_revolution.2.t: "Hungary Rejects Our Proposal!"
 ww1_hun_revolution.2.d: "Those snobish Maygars have foolishly rejected our proposal... everything we have worked for is collapsing around us.... what are we to do?!"

 ww1_hun_revolution.3.d: "Hungary has chosen to accept our proposal, a great catostrophe may have been just narrowly avoided, but yet... our prestige still took a large hit..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.3.a: "Oh Goody!"

 ww1_hun_revolution.4.b: "Screw off bastards!"
 ww1_hun_revolution.4.a: "Fine..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.5.t: "Hungarian Cry For Help"
 ww1_hun_revolution.5.d: "As the shortlived Austro-Hungarian union falls into the depths of hell, the Hungarians have reached out, crying for help!

 ww1_hun_revolution.5.a: "Crying on deaf ears"

Hungary is to remain in a personal union with the Austrian Empire, with the House of Habsburg-Lorraine remaining the ruling house\n2.Hungary is to mutually guarantee the independence of Germany in the case of Russian aggression\n3. Germany is to recieve resource rights to Nothern Hungary\n\nIf we decline Germany would be inclined to directly intervene..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.7.a: "Probably the best deal we can expect..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.7.b: "Fuck off!"
 ww1_hun_revolution.9.t: "Hungary Accepts Our Offer"

 ww1_hun_revolution.9.a: "Everything is fine... everything is fine..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.10.t: "Germany Arbitrates The Hungarian Revolution"
 ww1_hun_revolution.10.d: "The swift and dillegent work of German officials have secured a deal with the Hungarian revolutionaries; narrowly saving the ill Austrian Empire... though it's questionable how long this peace will last... Hungary signed the Treaty of Berlin; granting resources to Germany and aggreeing to mutually defend against eastern agression. The monarchy has also been re-instated in Hungary; however Franz Joseph has not re-assumed the throne and it is unlikely that the Archduke will either."
 ww1_hun_revolution.10.a: "A breathh of relief..."
 ww1_hun_revolution.10.b: "Why can't we all be friends?"

 ww1_hun_revolution.13.d: "An absolute embarassment! Our army has failed to subdue Hungary; in order to prevent further destruction we must cut our losses and recognize Hungarian independence.... our national prestige has already been under question... but now... we're ruined..."

 HUN_aftermath_of_werkle_desc:0 "In 1905, King Jozsef decided to dissolve parliment, due to the failure of the 1st Tisza government and the current impasse in parliment. The King called for new elections, expecting the Liberal Party to continue its 30 year ruling; however, to everyone's suprise the allied-opposition defeated the liberals. The allied opposition that won was the coalition of Independence and Forty-Eight Party (F48P). The F48P opposed the Dual Compromise of 1867 and advocated for the goals of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. The King of course would never agree to this, and therefore despite not having a parlimentary majority, appointed a strong-dualist. This government was shortlived and Sandor Werkle succeded as a compromise. The comrpomise government got little done and was beaten by the merge of the old liberal party, into the National Party of Work."

 ww1_hungary.10.t: "The Aster Revolution"
 ww1_hungary.10.d: "With the fallout of the Ausgleich in the midst of this great war, protests have become widespread by both tired civilians and aggrivated demobilized soldiers. The zealous social-democrat advocate, Mihály Károlyi, has emerged as the leader using the Aster flower as a symbol of the revolution. To stop a total collapse of the Ausgleich, the Emperor agreed to nominate Mihály Károlyi as Hungarian prime minister and asked him to form a government with the parties of the National Council. Károlyi assembled his cabinet that day. The revolution technically didn't change Hungary's legal status, as the new government still swore an oath to the king. However, afraid of the radicalized public opinion, Károlyi asked to be relieved of his oath by the next day 1 November, which he was granted. Subsequently the government took a new oath to the Hungarian National Council.\n\nAlthough the revolution in Budapest was relatively bloodless, a wave of violence and looting swept across the countryside as returning soldiers wrecked havoc on representatives of the old order, including the assasination of István Tisza, the former prime minister."
 ww1_hungary.10.a: "End of an Era!"
 ww1_hungary.11.t: "Disaster At Lemberg"
 ww1_hungary.11.d: "Russian Forces have broken through the lines in Galicia and Northern Bukovina, and weren't stopped until they reached Hungary proper, through some of the mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. While Alfred Redl's betrayal certainly contributed, defeat on this scale should not rest on only one man's shoulder. Leader of the Honvéd troops in the region, Dezső Kolossváry, seems to be a good candidate to put the blame on to. Thus we shall relieve of his duties on the front, and shall not lead troops in the future."
 ww1_hungary.11.a: "We have to point the finger at someone"

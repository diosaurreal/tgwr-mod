 ww_sverige_general.1003.d:0 "Presented in 1910, F-typen would be the a new Coastal Defence Ship for the Swedish navy which would based on its design be the largest ships to serve in the navy as of now. Plans are for Götaverken to handle the construction of these ships and for Bofors AB to make the artillery pieces for it.\n\nLiberal and Social Democratic elements in our Riksdag stand against its construction however, seeing it as yet another tax burden for our people that need to be culled."

 ww_sverige_neutralitet.13.d:0 "Our government has recently suffered a bit of setback on the diplomatic front due to Hammarskjöld recently speaking about the diplomatic front in a way that may show a bias against the Entente.\nWhile our diplomats are fixing this mishap, it may prove to be a trend."

 ww_sverige_neutralitet.14.d:0 "Following the outbreak of conflict in Europe, many came to look at the campaign promises made by the left as foolish. This has quickly led to increased pressure from the right for Karl Staaff to resign. While opposition from both Socialist and Liberals were strong at first, the press throughout Sweden was largely against the sitting regime. Even the king had voiced his concerns about the regime publicly, which recieved some backlash from sitting left-wing ministers in Riksdagen but was used as a further rallying point for the Right to oppose the current government.\n\nAfter a long conversation between Karl Staaff and the King himself behind closed doors, it was decided he'd resign in favor of Hammarskjöld as soon as feasible possible."
 ww_sverige_neutralitet.14.a:0 "He resigned?"

 ww_sverige_hungerskjold.0.d:0 "The Harvest of this last year has been far from as large as it should be, which has severly hurt our farmers. This has also caused prices to rise a bit and thus is slowly spreading problems to the rest of Sweden.\n\nWhile we're not directly in a famine, this may hurt us should we already be struggling with food shortages."
 ww_sverige_hungerskjold.0.a:0 "Let's pray next year we get more oats"
 
 ww_sverige_hungerskjold.1.t:0 "Rising Concerns About Food Costs"
 ww_sverige_hungerskjold.1.d:0 "More and more people within Sweden are growing concerned with the food situation at home, with public trust in the regime slowly dropping due to this."

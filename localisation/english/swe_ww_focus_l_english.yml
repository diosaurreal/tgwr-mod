With the right having lost many seats to the left and surprisingly there was a big growth for Socialdemokraterna.\nThough the biggest party in Riksdagen is Liberala samlingspartiet, they still don't hold majority by themselves and may be forced to work with Socialdemokraterna if they wish to secure majority in the First Chamber.\n\nKarl Staaff has been tasked with forming a government, but many on the right are worried that he may be too radical and have chosen to paint him as a Landsförrädare (traitor to the country)."

But we may be able to convince SAP to work with us to secure a majority in at least one of the chambers.

With his blatant opposition to Parliamentalism many on the left see him as a threat to the developing democracy in Sweden, meanwhile Arvid Lindman has personally refused to take part in a government led by Ernst Trygger however has for the time being not taken a stance of being an active opponent to the regime.

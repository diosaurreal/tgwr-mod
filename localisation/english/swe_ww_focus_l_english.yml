Ye are here with me to make known to all, that no demand is too high and no burden too heavy, when it comes to the preservation of our ancient freedom and the safeguarding of our future development.\nFrom times so distant, held hidden in times immemorial, the foundation of this realm has rested on the firm and unshakably welded trust between king and people.\nI shall, in accordance with My duty as Your king, seek to show You the way to reach our goal in common.

With the right having lost many seats to the left and surprisingly there was a big growth for Socialdemokraterna.\nThough the biggest party in Riksdagen is Liberala samlingspartiet, they still don't hold majority by themselves and may be forced to work with Socialdemokraterna if they wish to secure majority in the First Chamber.\n\nKarl Staaff has been tasked with forming a government, but many on the right are worried that he may be too radical and have chosen to paint him as a Landsförrädare (traitor to the country)."

Currently the question of Defense Minister is put forward and discussed, with Liberala samlingspartiet wishing to appoint a civil minister to the position rather than a military man. It is very clear however that the conservative members of Riksdagen, the King himself and the military would likely see this as an attempt to undermine their position and may make them more likely to try and undermine our regime.\n\nHowever backing down would undoubtedly hurt our position as well."

 # Messages
 national_protection_war_end_message: "The National Protection War ends without either side achieving a complete victory. While the total collapse is prevented, China would once again face a period of division and strife."
 national_protection_war_end_alt_message: "The National Protection have succeeded. From Yunnan to Hebei, the banners of those who seek to uphold the Republic are raised high. The false emperor has fallen, ambitious warlords have vanished, and those obsessed with factionalism have quietly fallen silent. Only the banner of saving the Chinese people flutters."
 zhili_anhui_war_end_message: "The monopoly of power held by Duan Qirui and the Anhui Clique has come to an end. As the leaders of Zhili and Fengtian face each other in Beijing, debating how to divide the regime, the common goal of overthrowing Anhui has vanished, leaving only a scramble for power."
 first_zhili_fengtian_war_end_message: "The first clashes between Zhili and Fengtian ended with a decisive victory for Zhili. Fengtian retreats back to its base and seeks reconciliation. Zhili has, for now, secured control of most of China's key regions."
 yung_feng_incident_message: "The coup in Guangzhou completely thwartes the KMT's Northern Expedition, leaving the KMT with an even more difficult path to take."
 second_zhili_fengtian_war_end_messsage: "Zhili's hegemony has been shattered. Cao Kun is overthrown, and Wu Peifu barely flees to his base. And in the void left by the collapse, Fengtian seeks to rule China."
 anti_chiang_war_end_message: "Countless warlords rose up against the one man who holds all power, but ultimately all power still lies with Chiang Kai-shek. Yet, to him, all he see is the bare face of China, a place of scars and destruction."
 anti_chiang_war_end_alt_message: "Countless warlords rose up against the one man who held all power, and now the power is with Yan Xishan, who reads the ocean currents more quietly and perfectly than anyone else. Yet, to him, all he see is the bare face of China, a place of scars and destruction."
 tanggu_truce_message: "China's internal divisions and impotence led to the Japanese invasion, the fall of Manchuria, and the greatest foreign threat ever. But China is not finished yet. South of the Great Wall, the central plains of the Huaxia people will once again awaken to their immense potential and march as a volunteer army, returning to its glory. Unless, of course, the dragon is beheaded before then."
 yunnan_kmt_message: "When Tang Jiyao lost power in Yunnan, the Yunnan Clique turns to allies with the Kuomintang."
 anti_fengtian_war_zhili_message: "Like an old fox, the Jade Marshal seek an opportunity for revenge. The Zhili Army rises again, determines to punish the man who stabbed him in the back."
 guangxi_kmt_message: "When Lu Rongting lost power in Guangxi, the Guangxi Clique turns to allies with the Kuomintang."
 northern_expedition_end_message: "The bright sun illuminates the land of China like a scorching red flame. There is not much left until the final chapter of the Chinese Republican Revolution. Yet, China remains scarred by warlordism, factionalism, and war. And perhaps another massive current threatens to tear China apart."
 anti_fengtian_war_fujian_message: "Fengtian's relentless army pauses for a moment, standing still. The Jiangnan region once again takes a different path from Beijing. And the one walking that path is the Smiling Tiger."
 khabarovsk_protocol_message: "Fengtian adventurism has been submerged in a red tide. Upon learning of his place, the young leader will be heartbroken and may even lose his judgment. But more importantly, the Red Army proved itself powerful not only in the snowfields and taiga of Russia, but also on the plains of Manchuria."
 khabarovsk_protocol_alt_message: "The young leader from Fengtian now has his sights set on a new goal: Just as a rock remains in the sand even when the red waves crash against it, China is ready to confront red imperialism."
 long_march_message: "Chinese socialists, enduring arduous hardships and opposition, find refuge in the mountains of Shaanxi. But at what cost? Did they really find the Canaan they had been promised?"

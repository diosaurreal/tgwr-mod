#Events
#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t: "Germany's Disgrace"
ww1_germanrework.1.d: "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Bethmann Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."
ww1_germanrework.1.a: "Bethmann Hollweg should stay."
ww1_germanrework.1.b: "The Kaiser pressures Bethmann Hollweg to resign."
ww1_germanrework.2.t: "The Kaiser Appoints von Heydebrand"
ww1_germanrework.2.d: "In a bold and decisive move, Kaiser Wilhelm II has appointed Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa as the new Chancellor of the German Empire. A figure renowned for his staunch conservatism and unwavering dedication to the Prussian ideals, von Heydebrand's ascent marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the empire.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Ernst von Heydebrand has long been a prominent voice in the German Conservative Party. His career has been characterized by a fervent advocacy for the preservation of traditional German values and institutions. A fierce opponent of liberalism and socialism, von Heydebrand has consistently championed policies that strengthen the monarchy, the military, and the agrarian interests that form the backbone of his support.\n\nVon Heydebrand's tenure is expected to usher in an era of intensified conservative governance. With a reputation for his iron will and unyielding principles, he is anticipated to reinforce the Kaiser's vision of a strong, unified Germany, poised to assert its influence on the European stage. However, his appointment is not without controversy, as it risks deepening the divides within the Reichstag and among the populace, who are increasingly restless with the status quo."
ww1_germanrework.2.a: "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t: "Factions on the Right"
ww1_germanrework.19.d: "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like Bethmann Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."
ww1_germanrework.19.a: "The Chancellor should tread with care."

#Potsdam Meeting
ww1_germanrework.89.t: "Meeting at Potsdam"
ww1_germanrework.89.d: "We received an invitation from the German government this morning, requesting the Tsar's presence at a meeting with Kaiser Wilhelm in Potsdam. The stated agenda concerned our respective spheres of influence in Persia. Seeing little disadvantage in discussions, the Tsar agreed to meet his German cousin.\n\nThe meeting was cordial and representatives between the two sides found themselves often agreeing with each other on Middle Eastern foreign policy. However, the atmosphere shifted when the German delegation proposed a formal, public declaration that neither Empire would undertake hostile actions against the other. Faced with this unexpected demand for a non-aggression pact, no formal agreement could be reached between our two nations."
ww1_germanrework.89.a: "They took it a step too far."
ww1_germanrework.90.t: "Disappointment at Potsdam"
ww1_germanrework.90.d: "The Russian Tsar and his delegates met with the Kaiser at Potsdam. Throughout the entire event, the whole affair seemed rather cordial with many delegates agreeing on matters of foreign policy in the Middle East. The two cousins, Wilhelm and Nicolas also seemed to be getting along well. However, despite this positive start, the talks ultimately collapsed. Our proposal for a mutual declaration of non-aggression, intended to secure peace between our empires, proved unacceptable to the Russians. Consequently, no formal agreement was signed, and the delegations departed with a sense of missed opportunity. Perhaps future circumstances will allow for renewed dialogue between Germany and Russia."
ww1_germanrework.90.a: "At least we agree on something."

ww1_germanrework.91.t: "Renewal of the Triple Alliance"
ww1_germanrework.91.d: "The renewal of the Triple Alliance was a diplomatic process involving Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary; this event was an opportunity for allies to meet in Vienna. Germany was represented by Gottlieb von Jagow, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Austria-Hungary sent its Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold. Italy was represented by Antonino di San Giuliano, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nDuring this discreet conference, the three allies discussed spheres of influence in North Africa, but also mutual guarantees that in the event of war, no party would make a separate peace. Beyond simply reviving central cooperation, this event was an opportunity to reiterate each party's commitment to the Triple Alliance."
ww1_germanrework.91.a: "A tedious necessity."
ww1_germanrework.91.b: "Let us hope it is enough to contain Russia."
ww1_germanrework.91.c: "We must reconcile Italian and Austrian ambitions!"
ww1_germanrework.91.e: "Excellent."

ww1_germanrework.92.t: "German Control of a Bucharest Newspaper"
ww1_germanrework.92.d: "In a shocking turn of events, it has come to our attention that the influential newspapers Seara and Minerva, owned by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, have been sold to a German consortium. These papers are now openly spreading pro-German propaganda throughout Bucharest, undermining our national resolve and war effort at a critical time. This act of subversion cannot be ignored."
ww1_germanrework.92.a: "Shut them down immediately!"

ww1_germanrework.93.t: "German Control of the Press"
ww1_germanrework.93.d: "As our nation commits to the war, we have discovered that the influential newspapers Slovo and Otechestvo have been sold to a consortium with close ties to the German Empire. The consequence of this is immediate and dangerous: these papers have begun to spread propaganda favouring the Central Powers, directly threatening to destabilize our war effort from within."
ww1_germanrework.93.a: "This subversion must end!"

ww1_germanrework.94.t: "The Dutch AG Vulcan Contract"
ww1_germanrework.94.d: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] has contracted our own AG Vulcan shipyard to construct four modern torpedo boats. With tensions rising across Europe, allowing these warships to be delivered to a neutral power could be unwise. We have a unique opportunity to freeze the delivery and requisition these vessels for the Kaiserliche Marine, bolstering our own fleet at the expense of the Dutch."
ww1_germanrework.94.a: "The ships will serve the Empire."
ww1_germanrework.94.b: "Honour the contract."

ww1_germanrework.95.t: "Germany Seizes Our Torpedo Boats!"
ww1_germanrework.95.d: "We had signed a contract with the German firm AG Vulcan for the construction of four Z-1 class torpedo boats. Now, with their construction complete, we have been informed that [GER.GetNameDefCap] has intervened. The ships will not be delivered. This blatant seizure of our property, ships that we legally purchased, is an outrageous violation of our contract and a deep insult to our sovereignty."
ww1_germanrework.95.a: "Outrageous!"

ww1_germanrework.96.t: "AG Vulcan Delivers New Ships"
ww1_germanrework.96.d: "The four Z-1 class torpedo boats we contracted from the German firm AG Vulcan have finally been completed. Despite the tense international climate, [GER.GetNameDefCap] has honoured the deal, and the manufacturer has informed us that the ships have been transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy. They will soon be ready for service."
ww1_germanrework.96.a: "Excellent!"

ww1_germanrework.97.t: "German Offer of Industrial Support"
ww1_germanrework.97.d: "Our German ally has offered us increased industrial, military, and technological aid to help us develop our war industry. In addition to providing low-interest loans, they are also offering the assistance of their advisors and the transfer of patents to facilitate the modernization of our industry. While such an offer may seem charitable, it risks making us a satellite of the German Empire, if that wasn't already the case..."
ww1_germanrework.97.a: "We need all the help we can get!"
ww1_germanrework.97.b: "We can manage on our own."

ww1_germanrework.98.t: "Austrian Cooperation"
ww1_germanrework.98.d: "As we anticipated, Austria has been cooperative and accepted our assistance, which will certainly accelerate the development of their war industry."
ww1_germanrework.98.a: "Good."

ww1_germanrework.99.t: "Austrian Defiance"
ww1_germanrework.99.d: "To our great surprise, Austria-Hungary has flatly refused our offer of aid, stating that their economic program is already flourishing and that they remain an independent power. This unexpected display of pride is concerning."
ww1_germanrework.99.a: "Their loss."

ww1_germanrework.100.t: "Improved Military and R&D Cooperation"
ww1_germanrework.100.d: "German and Austrian military experts met with us to discuss the potential of the Škoda Company in the construction of heavy guns. Germany expressed interest in Austrian Škoda 305mm super-heavy mortars. These anti-fortress artillery pieces have proven extremely effective in initial trials, and some of their feedback has allowed work to begin on improving the rotating pivot. In order to increase the range, a second project to enlarge the barrel is also being considered, giving this weapon the potential of a very long-range howitzer."
ww1_germanrework.100.a: "We might make great use of it."

ww1_germanrework.101.t: "Appointing a New Colonial Secretary"
ww1_germanrework.101.d: "The vacancy in the Reichskolonialamt (Imperial Colonial Office) requires us to select a new State Secretary, a choice that will significantly shape the governance of our overseas territories. Two distinct paths lie before us, embodied by the leading candidates:\n\nWilhelm Solf represents the reformist wing. A diplomat experienced in colonial administration, he advocates for a more conciliatory policy, seeking to improve efficiency and potentially ease tensions with colonial populations through administrative reforms rather than force.\n\nIn stark contrast, Eduard von Liebert champions a hardline, militaristic approach. A former governor with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong connections to nationalist and Pan-German circles, he favours asserting unwavering German dominance and pursuing aggressive colonial exploitation, regardless of the human cost. His appointment would signal a commitment to forceful expansion and control."
ww1_germanrework.101.a: "We need Solf's reforms."
ww1_germanrework.101.b: "Von Liebert will assert our dominance."

ww1_germanrework.102.t: "Ermächtigungsgesetz"
ww1_germanrework.102.d: "To allow the empire to finance the war by any means necessary, Parliament passed a law authorizing the introduction of exceptional measures dictated by the government. The Kaiser and the OHL can thus govern by decree, which facilitates war legislation and offers us many perspectives. Beyond these celebrations, it is important to note that Parliament can withdraw this exceptional authorization at any time, which would be a catastrophe for the war effort."
ww1_germanrework.102.a: "The coalition must hold the line!"

ww1_germanrework.175.t: "Hilfsdienstgesetz"
ww1_germanrework.175.d: "To achieve the total mobilization required by the Hindenburg Programme, the Supreme Army Command has pushed the Auxiliary Service Act through the Reichstag. The new law grants the state sweeping powers to direct all civilian labour towards the war effort. However, this authority came at a steep political price. To secure the assent of the socialists and their powerful trade unions, we were forced to grant them formal recognition and mandate the creation of worker arbitration committees. While this has secured industrial peace for now, it has also massively empowered the very groups who may yet turn against the war."
ww1_germanrework.175.a: "A necessary, if dangerous, compromise."

ww1_germanrework.176.t: "Abdication of Wilhelm II"
ww1_germanrework.176.d: "Following a loss of support from his military advisors and the realization that his continued rule would likely lead to further civil unrest and bloodshed Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated his throne. He left for exile in the Netherlands to escape prosecution."
ww1_germanrework.176.a: "Lebewohl für immer."

ww1_germanrework.177.t: "Erich von Falkenhayn Relieved of his Dual Duties"
ww1_germanrework.177.d: "Being both the Minister of War and the Chief of the General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn has been retired from the position of the Prussian Minister of War."
ww1_germanrework.177.a: "You can't sit in two chairs at once."

ww1_germanrework.178.t: "The Lion of Africa"
ww1_germanrework.178.d: "A dispatch, arriving via a daring blockade-running submarine, has brought excellent news from our colonies. General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck has formally taken command of all forces in German East Africa.\n\nThe newly raised Askari brigades have rallied to his banner, creating a small but elite force of hardened veterans ready for action. From his headquarters in Dar es Salaam, von Lettow-Vorbeck has already begun preparations to launch his unorthodox campaign against the Entente. The 'Lion of Africa' is now loose, and he will make the enemy pay dearly for every inch of our colonial soil."
ww1_germanrework.178.a: "We have the utmost faith in his abilities."

ww1_germanrework.179.t: "The Death of Helmuth von Moltke"
ww1_germanrework.179.d: "Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, the man who served as Chief of the General Staff at the outbreak of the Great War and was relieved of his duties following the battle of the Marne, has passed away.\n\nLiving in relative obscurity since 1914, Moltke's end came suddenly. He suffered a fatal stroke today, June 18th, 1916, while attending a state memorial service in the Reichstag for the late Field Marshal Colmar von der Goltz. The man whose name will forever be linked to the war's opening gambit is no more."
ww1_germanrework.179.a: "A tragic end for a troubled man."

ww1_germanrework.180.t: "Alfred von Tirpitz Threatens to Resign Over U-boat Restrictions"
ww1_germanrework.180.d: "Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted U-boat warfare, which he felt could strangle Britain's supply of food and force them to terms. With the reversal of the policy he started agitating against all restrictions using the German press, and threats to resign."
ww1_germanrework.180.a: "You didn't even focus on U-boats that much!"

ww1_germanrework.181.t: "Alfred von Tirpitz Resigns"
ww1_germanrework.181.d: "His agitation resulted in a fall out with the Kaiser, and when the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he finally resigned."
ww1_germanrework.181.a: "So much for that."

GER_viability_of_the_coalition_desc: "The 'fortress peace' coalition assembled by Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg is fragile, and with each passing day the balance within the Reichstag becomes more unstable. If we fail to maintain this wartime unity, we risk losing everything."

ww1_germanrework.103.t: "Silesia for Tyrol?"
ww1_germanrework.103.d: "German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg traveled to Vienna to negotiate a concession plan aimed at permanently easing the icy Austro-Italian relations. Aware of our army's difficulties, the minister offered to exchange his own territory if we agreed to accede to Italy's demands.\n\nIn other words, we could offer Tyrol and receive Silesia in exchange. This proposal is very attractive; Silesia is an industrialized territory and composed of German speakers, which is to our advantage."
ww1_germanrework.103.a: "It is a fair deal."
ww1_germanrework.103.b: "Never!"

ww1_germanrework.104.t: "Tyrol for Guarantees?"
ww1_germanrework.104.d: "We received an Austrian delegation proposing an easing of territorial tensions in Tyrol. The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy seems serious about its approach and has offered to cede part of its territory—that is, the entirety of Tyrol—in exchange for the restoration of friendly relations between the two nations. More formally, this would prevent us from declaring war on them, at the very least."
ww1_germanrework.104.a: "It is a fair deal."
ww1_germanrework.104.b: "Never!"

ww1_germanrework.105.t: "Austrian Refusal"
ww1_germanrework.105.d: "Despite all our efforts, Austria-Hungary was not convinced by our proposed exchange. It seems they fear that even this grand gesture would not be enough to satisfy Italy's ambitions."
ww1_germanrework.105.a: "Damn them!"

ww1_germanrework.106.t: "Italy Refuses to Negotiate"
ww1_germanrework.106.d: "Despite all our efforts, Italy was not convinced by the Austro-German proposal, perhaps fearing a betrayal or believing they can gain more through war."
ww1_germanrework.106.a: "Damn them!"

ww1_germanrework.107.t: "Peace in the Alps"
ww1_germanrework.107.d: "The appeasement diplomacy initiated by German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has borne fruit; the Italian government has promised not to go to war against the Central Powers and may even support us in our war. This is a major diplomatic victory, preventing the opening of a new front in the West."

#Haldane Mission
ww1_germanrework.83.t: "Germany Invites Viscount Haldane"
ww1_germanrework.83.d: "The German government under the directive of the pro-British Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, has invited his close friend Viscount Richard Haldane, to Germany to pursue a diplomatic agreement between the two nations to end the naval race. Opinions in Parliament are divided but our government is willing to offer Germany the following terms:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions and, after discussion, would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome."
ww1_germanrework.83.a: "We shall send Haldane to see what can be achieved."
ww1_germanrework.83.b: "We will not negotiate with the Germans."
ww1_germanrework.84.t: "Britain Refuses Diplomatic Talks"
ww1_germanrework.84.d: "Much to our dismay it seems the British are not interested in negotiation with us. Alas, Admiral Tirpitz has instead convinced the Kaiser to force the Reichstag to pass a new Naval Law as soon as possible to expand the German Navy."
ww1_germanrework.84.a: "They can't say we didn't try!"
ww1_germanrework.85.t: "Britain Sends Viscount Haldane, Tirpitz Demands New Naval Law"
ww1_germanrework.85.d: "Britain has agreed to send Viscount Haldane on a diplomatic mission to Germany. After his arrival, he gave both the government and the Kaiser the following terms of an agreement:\n\n1. Germany would recognise Britain's naval superiority and stop all expansion of navy expenditure, preferably reducing it.\n2. Britain would not interfere with German colonial ambitions, and after discussion would be willing to help Germany with special points of Colonial affairs.\n3. Future discussions to prevent either power from joining in a war against each other would be welcome.\n\nThe Reichstag supported the mission, but Admiral Tirpitz denounced the mission and instead asked the Kaiser to pass a new naval law which would spark an increase in naval tension between the two nations again."
ww1_germanrework.85.a: "We must forge our own destiny at sea! Pass the naval law!"
ww1_germanrework.85.b: "Securing British neutrality would be a great victory."
ww1_germanrework.86.t: "Germany Announces New Naval Expansion"
ww1_germanrework.86.d: "Soon after Viscount Haldane landed in Germany, the Kaiser had the gall to tour him around the shipyards at Wilhelmshaven and jest about the expansion of the German navy! This insult only hurt more when it was soon announced that the Reichstag would pass a new Naval Law which would expand the German navy even more so. Haldane resigned his offer of treaty soon after this and returned to Britain."
ww1_germanrework.86.a: "The arrogance of the Germans knows no bounds."
ww1_germanrework.87.t: "Germany Accepts Our Treaty"
ww1_germanrework.87.d: "The Prime Minister has happily announced to the nation that an agreement has been signed between Germany and Britain ending the naval race.

With British naval superiority secured, our nation can stand tall once again."

ww1_germanrework.88.d: "Across Europe, the foreign ministries of France and Russia are abuzz with worry. After a period of detente between Britain and Germany, the two nations came to an agreement that recognized Britain's naval supremacy, and in return distanced Britain's presence from the Triple Entente. This agreement could sign that more treaties between the two nations could be signed that would commit Britain to a path of neutrality in a future European conflict."

#1907 Federal Budget
ww1_germanrework.45.t: "The 1912 Imperial Budget"
ww1_germanrework.45.d: "Debate rages in the Reichstag over the new federal budget. With rising demands from industry, workers, and the military, Germany must now choose how to prioritize its resources. Liberals and social reformers call for investment in welfare, infrastructure, and education. Conservatives and the officer corps demand higher military spending and colonial expansion. The path we choose will shape the Empire's future."
ww1_germanrework.45.a: "A liberal budget to modernize the Reich."  
ww1_germanrework.45.b: "A conservative budget - power through strength."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t: "Strikes in Hamburg"
ww1_germanrework.3.d: "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."
ww1_germanrework.3.a: "We must negotiate with the stikers."
ww1_germanrework.4.t: "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
ww1_germanrework.4.d: "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently bought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."
ww1_germanrework.4.a: "Damned socialists."

#1910 Debate in Prussian Parliment on the "royal civil list"
ww1_germanrework.5.t: "Stormy Debate on the Royal Civil List"
ww1_germanrework.5.d: "A heated debate erupted today in the Prussian Landtag (House of Representatives) when the issue of the 'Royal Civil List' was raised. At the Kaiser's request, payments from the state budget to the royal family are proposed to be increased.\n\nDuring the debate, the Social Democrat representative Adolph Hoffmann stated before the assembly that the Kaiser already enjoys a daily income of 43,065 Marks, even without the proposed increase. This pointed criticism provoked outrage among the Centrist and Right-wing factions of the house. The President of the Landtag even went so far as to denounce Hofmann as a 'traitor'.\n\nWhile the increase itself is almost certain to pass, the incident has subjected the SPD's revisionist wing to heightened scrutiny from the right, questioning their loyalty after this seemingly 'traitorous' stance."
ww1_germanrework.5.a: "Hoffmann is right. The Kaiser requires no further funds!"
ww1_germanrework.5.b: "Damn the traitors! The Kaiser deserves our loyalty!"

#1911 Anti-Semitism in the Army
ww1_germanrework.6.t: "The Centre Criticises Anti-Semitism in the Army"
ww1_germanrework.6.d: "In a notable session of the Reichstag, the Zentrum has voiced its concerns over the increasing antisemitic rhetoric within the German Empire's political discourse. The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."
ww1_germanrework.6.a: "A matter of some concern..."

#1911 Change to Electoral Law in Grand Duchy of Hesse
ww1_germanrework.7.t: "Electoral Reform in Hesse"
ww1_germanrework.7.d: "The Grand Duchy of Hesse has reformed its electoral law. While the old system of census suffrage based on wealth has been abolished, it has been replaced by a system of plural voting which grants a second vote to all male citizens over the age of fifty. This conservative compromise, designed to counterbalance the effect of a broader franchise, has been condemned by the Social Democrats. The move has only strengthened their campaign for true, equal suffrage."
ww1_germanrework.7.a: "A strange sort of progress."

#1911 Anglo-German Arm Treaties, do not do the locs for these until the ai chance is done
ww1_germanrework.8.t: "Arms Limitation Deal with Great Britain?"
ww1_germanrework.8.d: "The British government has sent a delegation here to [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in the hopes of signing a mutual arms production limitation pact. England is indeed seeking to limit tensions in Europe, which naturally involves reducing military escalation in the region. Such a pact could make us look good to the British, while redirecting some of our budget elsewhere... However, we cannot be certain that a war will not break out, one way or another."
ww1_germanrework.8.a: "Alas, we must decline."

ww1_germanrework.9.d: "The [FROM.getAdjective] government declined our offer of mutual arms limitation. In a letter sent to our delegation, [FROM.getLeader] assured us of its good intentions toward our country, adding that third-party threats were preventing it from signing such an agreement."
ww1_germanrework.9.a: "As expected..."
ww1_germanrework.10.t: "[FROM.getNameDefCap] Enters Arms Limitation Pact with Britain"
ww1_germanrework.10.d: "After several days of negotiations, the British government and the [FROM.getAdjective] government have reached a pact to limit arms stocks. The agreement, signed at [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], provides for a gradual reduction in production by both nations, hoping to spread this movement throughout Europe and then the world."

#1912 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.11.t: "Strikes in the Ruhr"
ww1_germanrework.11.d: "Earlier this week, in the Ruhr region, 170,000 miners left their workplaces to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. As of now, the owners of the mines have yet to even attempt to negotiate with the strikes, clearly planning to wait out the strike. The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has voiced its support for the strikers, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers. In response, the Centre Party has shifted to the right, proposing financial aid to the mine owners to compensate for their losses."
ww1_germanrework.11.a: "We shall not negotiate with the unions."
ww1_germanrework.11.b: "For the greater good, we should negotiate."

#1912 Ruhr Accident
ww1_germanrework.12.t: "Mining Accident in the Ruhr"
ww1_germanrework.12.d: "A solum day for the Reich, Kaiser Wilhelm recently visited the scene of a mining accident in the Ruhr region to pay respects to the deceased miners. Current deaths are totaled at 115 miners. This follows the strikes in the mines earlier this year and the accident has given the far-left of the Rhur reason to once again begin calling for strikes. Whilst the Kaiser and his people mourn for the dead, a government response to the accident is to be printed in the press soon."
ww1_germanrework.12.a: "A sad day for the Reich."

#National Census
ww1_germanrework.18.t: "The Findings of the National Census"
ww1_germanrework.18.d: "The findings of the national census have been delivered and examined by the administration. After reviewing the findings, a document has been prepared to advise the Reichstag and the Kaiser of the conclusions. These documents have highlighted how large portions of the empire lack vital infrastructure compared to our competitors in Europe, mass urbanization has led to housing shortages and public health growth is minimal - even reverting in some cities. These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."
ww1_germanrework.18.a: "Perhaps German society is not as progressive as we thought..."

#1912 Miltary Conferance
ww1_germanrework.20.t: "The Kaiser Calls for a War Council"
ww1_germanrework.20.d: "Meeting at the Stadtschloss in Berlin, the Kaiser has called a War Council between the highest military leaders in the German Empire. It's expected that the topics of discussion will follow the tense military and diplomatic situation in Europe. Specific topics will naturally focus on Russia's 'Great Military Plan', Austria-Hungary's concerns about Serbian military action, and the relationship of the Empire with the British.\n\nKnown attendees include Tirpitz, Muller, Molkte, and Heeringen, with an equally strong presence from the Army and the Navy.\n\nAs preparations and talks about Germany's place in a war in Europe, each day brings war closer to the Reich and do doubt, soon legislature will be passed to expand the German armed forces to meet a new era of war."
ww1_germanrework.20.a: "A major war is on the horizon."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t: "Wilhelmine Germany"
ww1_germanrework.21.d: "Ascending to the throne in 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm II ushered in an era defined by surging national ambition and industrial might. Fueled by intense nationalism and a belief in military strength, [GER.GetNameDef]'s pursuit of Weltpolitik - seeking global influence and a 'place in the sun' - drives its actions on the world stage.\n\nRapid industrialization has transformed [GER.GetNameDef] into an economic powerhouse, reshaping its society in the process. This economic power fuels Admiral von Tirpitz's ambitious naval expansion, aimed at challenging British sea power.\n\nDomestically, the rise of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), championing the interests of the burgeoning working class, creates internal political friction with the conservative establishment.\n\nExternally, the quest for global influence has led [GER.GetNameDef] to discard Bismarck's careful web of alliances in favour of the 'Politik der freien Hand' (Policy of the Free Hand). This assertive approach, prioritising diplomatic flexibility over established commitments, has heightened tensions with other European powers and contributed to a sense of 'encirclement' by the Triple Entente. Nevertheless, the Triple Alliance with [AUS.GetNameDef] and [ITA.GetNameDef] remains a crucial counterbalance.\n\nPowerful and ambitious, Wilhelmine Germany faces a challenging future, beset by internal discord and international tensions."
ww1_germanrework.21.a: "Germany sails a steady course."

#Socialism in Germany
ww1_germanrework.22.t: "Social Democracy in the German Empire"
ww1_germanrework.22.d: "The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has grown significantly since unification, dominating the political left in the Reichstag alongside the Progressive People's Party (FVP). This rise is mirrored by the increasing power of trade unions, fueled by German industrial expansion.\n\nHowever, declining working conditions amid soaring production demands have led to growing unrest among unionised workers. While currently decentralized and lacking unified leadership, these unions hold the potential to cripple the economy if their grievances are ignored. The government must tread carefully, balancing concessions to labour with the need to placate powerful conservative forces within the Reichstag and the establishment."
ww1_germanrework.22.a: "The demands of the socialists must not distract us."

#The Fleeting Right-Wing
ww1_germanrework.23.t: "The Fleeting Right-Wing"
ww1_germanrework.23.d: "Germany's right wing has always been favored by both the aristocracy and farmers, composed of conservative, agricultural, and nationalist parties. However, the decline of right-wing has become more and more clear as the second industrial revolution catalyzed the formation of leftist unions and bolstered support for the Social Democrats. Due to this many of the conservative parties have begun to adapt their policies to ensure they can keep their key voter's support; the conservatives continue to advocate for a self-sufficient economy less reliant on trade, especially with nations like Britain who pose a threat to German ambitions and the agriculturists call for tax exemptions for farmers to give them the support they need to feed the newly urbanized populations. If the right-wing is to revive itself it must set a clear goal that the rightist parties can follow, or else the right will be crushed under the tide of social democracy."
ww1_germanrework.23.a: "Perhaps the right can still be revived..."

##1914 The Royal Approval of Frankfurt university
ww1_germanrework.24.t: "The Founding of Frankfurt University"
ww1_germanrework.24.d: "The University of Frankfurt on Main was established on September 28th, 1912, when the foundation for forming the university was passed by Frankfurt's city government. It has it's roots in Goethe University, which was established in 1484, but was not officially considered to be one under German customs, as it did not issue degrees for almost half a millennia. Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."
ww1_germanrework.24.a: "The German mind will never be sullied."

#1914 Albert Einstein Comes to Germany
ww1_germanrework.25.t: "Einstein Comes to Germany"
ww1_germanrework.25.d: "Albert Einstein, the renowned theoretical physicist, was recently offered a job as the director of the new Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, as well as membership in the Prussian Academy of Science and the Humboldt Academy of Berlin in order to be funded to conduct research. Max Planck - a theoretical physicist who served as president of the German Physical Institute from 1905 to 1909, and creator of Planck's Constant - and Walther Nernst - friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II and thermodynamic physicist - convinced Einstein to take these jobs. "
ww1_germanrework.25.a: "Great minds are always welcome!"

#Formation of the OHL
ww1_germanrework.40.t: "Formation of the OHL"
ww1_germanrework.40.d: "After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Prussian Army, Royal Saxon Army, Army of Württemberg and the Bavarian Army were autonomous in peacetime, each kingdom maintaining a separate war ministry and general staff to administer their forces. On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire ensures that the German Emperor would be made commander-in-chief of the combined armies.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Oberste Heeresleitung is now the highest echelon of command of the Heer of the German Empire, led by general Moltke. The OHL is split into sections that will take control over different parts of the country, whilst also monitoring politics and taking over the economy to ensure production remains most efficient for the army.\n\nIn addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consists of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers. "
ww1_germanrework.40.a: "To war, then."

#The Centre Block
ww1_germanrework.41.t: "The Centre Bloc"
ww1_germanrework.41.d: "The Centre of Germany has been the dominant force in the Empire's governing politics since its creation. The centrists are led by the trusted Zentrum party who formed in 1870, went on to successfully battle against the Kulturkampf waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. However, there are plenty of centrist parties in Germany who seek to make moderate social reform whilst ensuring that German traditional values are kept.\n\nIf Germany is going to continue to be stable throughout the next decade, the centrists must keep their power in Germany so that a moderate amount of rightist and leftist laws are passed into the bundesrat. Luckily, many of the key political figures in Germany, like Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, support the centrists and have aided them in keeping their majority in the Reichstag. "
ww1_germanrework.41.a: "Imperialism in moderation."

#The Growing Pan-German Influence
ww1_germanrework.42.t: "The Matter of the Pan-Germans"
ww1_germanrework.42.d: "Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein their goals were never truly achieved. After the unification, from the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, who since 1891 were organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, even calling for the annexation of Austria. The organization has greatly supported the educated middle and upper class; promoting German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, 'Deutsche Politik' (1905-07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe which many of the League have taken to heart.\n\nHowever, since the dawn of this new millennium, the Pan-Germans have taken a moderate stance to Austria, instead focusing on annexations in Russia and France. It seems for now the Pan-Germans have abandoned the annexationist policy around Austria."
ww1_germanrework.42.a: "Germany must sail a steady course."
ww1_germanrework.42.b: "We must seek shelter from the left."
ww1_germanrework.42.c: "They do have some valid points..."

#German/Belgian Colonial Event Chain #test out before making loc
GER_diamond_profits: "Diamond Profits"
ww1_germanrework.15.t: "An Offer from Berlin"
ww1_germanrework.15.d: "We have received a formal proposition from the German Colonial Office regarding the vast mineral wealth of the Congo Basin. They propose a joint venture between our colonial administrations to coordinate and expand diamond mining operations across both the Belgian Congo and their adjacent territories.\n\nTheir proposal argues that a combined effort would lead to greater efficiency and profitability for both our nations. The Germans await our reply."
ww1_germanrework.15.a: "A most profitable venture. We accept."
ww1_germanrework.15.b: "We will not be drawn into their colonial schemes."

ww1_germanrework.16.t: "A Favourable Reply from Brussels"
ww1_germanrework.16.d: "The government of Belgium has accepted our proposition for a joint venture in the Congo Basin. Their colonial administration has been instructed to cooperate with our own to begin expanding diamond extraction operations.\n\nThis agreement will surely prove to be a lucrative endeavour for both our Empires."
ww1_germanrework.16.a: "Excellent. To our mutual prosperity!"

ww1_germanrework.17.t: "The Belgians Decline"
ww1_germanrework.17.d: "A diplomatic cable has arrived from Brussels. The Belgian government has formally declined our offer to coordinate diamond exploitation in the Congo Basin.\n\nWhile this outcome is disappointing, it is not entirely unexpected. Their caution is their loss."
ww1_germanrework.17.a: "So be it. We will proceed alone."

#Adressing the matter of the German Identity
ww1_germanrework.43.t: "The Minority Question"
ww1_germanrework.43.d: "The unification of Germany under Prussian leadership incorporated vast territories inhabited by non-German peoples, most notably Poles and Danes. Despite ongoing Germanisation policies, a silent cultural resistance persists in these regions, challenging the very notion of a homogenous Imperial state.\n\nThis long-simmering issue has now come to a head in the Reichstag. Centrist and left-leaning factions, championed by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, argue for expanding the rights of minorities. They believe that granting them the same state benefits and legal protections as ethnic Germans will foster loyalty and strengthen the Empire from within. Conversely, nationalist and right-wing elements demand a stricter approach, proposing that the rights of non-Germans be curtailed to redirect resources toward the betterment of 'true' Germans."
ww1_germanrework.43.a: "Equality will ensure their loyalty."
ww1_germanrework.43.b: "A German Empire for the Poles? I think not."

#The State of the Navy
ww1_germanrework.44.t: "The State of the Navy"
ww1_germanrework.44.d: "Under Admiral Tirpitz's guidance, the German Navy has expanded rapidly. He firmly believes Germany needs a powerful fleet to rival Britain and secure its future. Four naval bills have already been passed under Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Tirpitz is likely preparing to push for a fifth.\n\nThe Navy stands as a considerable force, yet if Germany truly intends to challenge British naval supremacy, significantly greater investment in naval production will be essential to match their formidable might."
ww1_germanrework.44.a: "Onwards, to our place in the sun!"

# Moltke can't cope with defeat
ww1_germanrework.46.t: "Moltke Relieved of Command"
ww1_germanrework.46.d: "The failure of our initial offensive to deliver a swift victory and the subsequent descent into trench warfare on the Western Front have taken their toll. The health of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the General Staff, has collapsed under the immense strain of command, rendering him unfit for service.\n\nThe Kaiser has been forced to 'retire' him, appointing the Prussian Minister of War, Erich von Falkenhayn, as his successor. It is hoped that Falkenhayn's more pragmatic approach will allow us to stabilize the front in the West while seeking a decisive victory against Russia in the East."
ww1_germanrework.46.a: "Let us hope Falkenhayn is up to the task."

#Falk Removed
ww1_germanrework.47.t: "Falkenhayn Removed as Chief of the Army"
ww1_germanrework.47.d: "Contrary to Falkenhayn's expectations, the Entente was able to limit casualties in the divisions sent to the front. The procession of divisions back and forth was analogous to the operation of a 'noria', a type of water wheel that continuously lifts water and empties it into a trough which allowed the entente to scupper Falkenhayn's plan.\n\nOn top of this, both Hindenburg and Ludendorff have made clear they will resign from their positions unless Falkenhayn is removed and Hindenburg appointed head of the OHL using his failures to achieve their ambitions, the Kaiser if left with no choice but to accept."

ww1_germanrework.52.d: "We've received a request from Germany, following the success of the Haldane mission, to support them in their demand to annex Angola from Portugal. Whilst Portugal has been our ally for some time, we did also promise to Germany we would support them in their colonial ambitions when we could... Leaving us in a predicament. However, the point has been made that if we back German it's more likely Portugal will peacefully agree to Germany's demands."

ww1_germanrework.55.d: "Earlier this morning, the German embassy have given our government an ultimatum to hand over the colony of Angola to the German Empire with haste, as a form of 'debt' repayment to Germany.

#The Zabern Affair
#A Crisis Stirs
ww1_germanrework.26.t: "A Crisis Stirs in Zabern"
ww1_germanrework.26.d: "In the garrison town of Zabern, the young Second Lieutenant Günther von Forstner has publicly insulted the local Alsatian inhabitants. Press reports quote Forstner as telling his troops: 'If you are attacked, then make use of your weapon; if you stab such a Wackes in the process, then you'll get ten marks from me.'\n\nThe press has seized upon the incident, inflaming local sentiment and prompting strong protests against the military's conduct in Alsace-Lorraine."
ww1_germanrework.26.a: "It would be wise to keep an eye on this situation."
ww1_germanrework.27.t: "Further Troubles in Zabern"
ww1_germanrework.27.d: "After the events earlier this week, pressure from the Alsatian's and the SPD, the military saw fit to give Forstner 7 days house arrest, which was later repealed at his second hearing. Unfortunately, unimpressed by these actions, the Alsatian public continued to protest. As a further provocation, Lieutenant Forstner was reported to go out and aggravate the public after having his punishment repealed. Soon after a huge crowd of people again assembled before the barracks, which led to what the military court has called an 'inappropiate counter-reaction of the troops.'"
ww1_germanrework.27.a: "Let us hope this dies down..."
ww1_germanrework.27.b: "Listen to Bethmann Hollweg and punish Forstner."
ww1_germanrework.28.t: "The Zabern Affair"
ww1_germanrework.28.d: "The incident at Zabern is spiralling into a national crisis, far exceeding the Kaiser's initial expectations. Protests have spread across the nation in support of the Alsatian demands for justice. Matters have worsened as the press reports that the Kaiser had to be convinced by his wife to leave a hunting trip to deal with the crisis, and that he is now excluding the Chancellor from meetings, heeding only the military's counsel.\n\nChancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg is now in an impossible position. His duty is to the Kaiser, yet the Reichstag is calling for a vote of censure against him to show their disapproval. To save his position and for the good of the state, Bethmann Hollweg could align himself with the Reichstag and join their calls for justice."
ww1_germanrework.28.a: "The Chancellor will remain loyal to the Kaiser."
ww1_germanrework.28.b: "Bethmann Hollweg will side with the Reichstag."
ww1_germanrework.29.t: "The Censure Vote"
ww1_germanrework.29.d: "As predicted, the Reichstag has called for a vote of censure against the leadership of Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg.\n\nEarlier this week, the Chancellor delivered his first speech to defend his government. He remained defiant, staunchly defending the actions of the Kaiser and the military command. This did little to endear him to the Reichstag; audible displays of protest were heard from the left-wing parties throughout his address. This morning, he delivered a final speech, appealing to the political centre in the hope that their votes will be enough to turn the tide."
ww1_germanrework.29.a: "The die is cast."
ww1_germanrework.30.t: "The Votes Are In"
ww1_germanrework.30.d: "After a tense session in the Reichstag, the votes have been counted. The result is a defeat for the government. It has now been officially declared that the Chancellor's actions do not reflect the will of the Reichstag.\n\nWhile this vote does not legally compel Bethmann Hollweg to resign, especially as the Kaiser shows no willingness to dismiss him, to continue on would expose the limits of German democracy and irrevocably tarnish the Chancellor's reputation."
ww1_germanrework.30.a: "Bethmann Hollweg will march on."
ww1_germanrework.30.b: "The Chancellor resigns."
ww1_germanrework.31.t: "The Old Order Holds"
ww1_germanrework.31.d: "The events of the past few weeks have finally concluded, with little consequence for the echelons of power, much to the dismay of the left-wing parties. The Chancellor continues his work, now opposed by the SPD but having appeased the military. The Zabern Affair will be remembered as a critical test of our authority in Elsass-Lothringen. One can only hope the Alsatian people will come to accept their German identity with more haste."
ww1_germanrework.31.a: "An uneasy stability returns."
ww1_germanrework.32.t: "A Swift Resolution"
ww1_germanrework.32.d: "Opting to impose a swift punishment on Lieutenant von Forstner, the Kaiser has averted a political and constitutional crisis. Upon being briefed on the escalating situation, he cut short his hunting trip and ordered that Forstner be disciplined. The Reichstag and the local Alsatians are placated but, as expected, the military leadership feels scorned and dishonoured by this direct intervention into its affairs."
ww1_germanrework.32.a: "You cannot please everyone."
ww1_germanrework.33.t: "Constitutional Crisis"
ww1_germanrework.33.d: "By siding with the Reichstag, Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg has openly challenged the military's influence over civilian affairs. He and the legislature now stand united against the traditional power of the General Staff. Appeasing the Reichstag will undoubtedly anger the military command, but it may be necessary to preserve the civil government. The time has come to decide where the ultimate authority in the German Empire lies."
ww1_germanrework.33.a: "Empower Bethmann Hollweg. The millitary must know its place."
ww1_germanrework.33.b: "Dismiss Bethmann Hollweg. The Army's authority is absolute."
ww1_germanrework.34.t: "The Zabern Affair"
ww1_germanrework.34.d: "A political and social controversy has erupted in the town of Zabern in Alsace-Lorraine, exposing deep tensions between military authority and civil society. The incident began with a confrontation between a soldier and civilians which escalated, leading to excessive military force and arbitrary arrests. The local military commanders dismissed civilian concerns, further inflaming public outrage. The affair has now become a national issue, with factions in the Reichstag, particularly the Social Democrats, demanding accountability and reform."
ww1_germanrework.34.a: "The Kaiser's uniform must be respected under all circumstances!"
ww1_germanrework.34.b: "The military is not above the rule of law!"

#Krupp-Vickers Collab
ww1_germanrework.73.t: "Krupp and Vickers Announce Joint Industrial Venture"
ww1_germanrework.73.d: "In a remarkable development, representatives of Friedrich Krupp AG and Vickers Ltd. have signed a formal agreement establishing a joint industrial consortium. The venture, hailed as unprecedented, will facilitate technological cooperation, resource sharing, and coordinated research in metallurgy, heavy machinery, and naval engineering.\n\nWhile ostensibly commercial, the implications are deeply political. For decades, Krupp and Vickers symbolized the naval arms race between Germany and Britain. That the two firms now work side by side is seen by many as a sign of strategic détente.\n\nThe German Foreign Office has welcomed the news, citing it as proof that mutual interest and rational cooperation can triumph over rivalry. In London, reactions are more measured, but cautiously optimistic."
ww1_germanrework.73.a: "Economic logic overcomes old enmities."


ww1_germanrework.74.t: "Status of Elsaß and Lothringen"
ww1_germanrework.74.d: "Elsaß-Lothringen is a Reichsland, which is an imperial land under the direct authority of the German Empire since its annexation in 1871. Governed by a Statthalter appointed by the Emperor, the region lacks the autonomy enjoyed by other federal states. Its population, largely composed of Alsatian and French speakers, has long expressed discontent with central control and the ongoing Germanization policies affecting education and public life.\n\nWith the promulgation of a new constitution, and the establishement of a regional parliament, some limited legislative powers on local matters will be provided. The territory will also gains representation in both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, enhancing its participation in imperial affairs. While key authority remains in Berlin, this reform might marks a significant step toward integration within the federal structure and is widely seen as a move to address longstanding regional grievances."
ww1_germanrework.74.a: "We will solve this issue soon enough."

ww1_germanrework.75.t: "Modernization of the Schlieffen Plan?"
ww1_germanrework.75.d: "The General Staff is pressing for a rewrite of the Schlieffen Plan, designed to invade France via the Benelux. The Generalstab has proposed a more aggressive version of the plan, aiming to leave the Netherlands behind and instead focus on a forward offensive directly against Belgium.\n\nWar Minister Josias von Heeringen has already made it clear that, in his view, such a plan is too risky and would exhaust soldiers and immobilize the front. Many other generals disagree, and a decision must be made on whether or not to approve this new plan."
ww1_germanrework.75.a: "The new plan is a sound compromise."
ww1_germanrework.75.b: "Stick to the original plan."

ww1_germanrework.76.t: "Failure on Western Front"
ww1_germanrework.76.d: "Despite intense mobilization by our army, we have not managed to take control of Verdun-sur-Meuse. In addition to being a strategic artery, the region is fortified, which would have opened the door to a broader offensive from which we will not be able to take advantage."
ww1_germanrework.76.a: "Damn!"

ww1_germanrework.77.t: "Ludendorff Offensive Fails"
ww1_germanrework.77.d: "The Somme offensive was a failure; our forces failed to achieve the objectives set by the General Staff. This latest failure threatens to demoralize the troops, especially as the war drags on..."
ww1_germanrework.77.a: "Damn!"

ww1_germanrework.78.t: "Ypres Still Stands"
ww1_germanrework.78.d: "Despite our renewed efforts, Belgium still holds the Ypres sector and has therefore not completely relinquished its territory. It seems we will have to face the Belgians for some time to come."
ww1_germanrework.78.a: "Damn!"

ww1_germanrework.79.t: "First Armored Brigade Formed"
ww1_germanrework.79.d: "The first batches of Joseph Vollmer's heavy tank are ready, forming enough units for support use or large battalions. Due to the high cost of the tank, the A7V has not yet been mass-produced, its usefulness remaining to be proven in the field."
ww1_germanrework.79.a: "We will see its worth very soon."

ww1_germanrework.80.t: "Failure on the Eastern Front"
ww1_germanrework.80.d: "The major offensive we launched against Russia failed to achieve its agreed objectives, despite the intense efforts of our army. This strategic defeat slightly demoralized the troops, in addition to causing unnecessary losses."
ww1_germanrework.80.a: "Damn!"

ww1_germanrework.81.t: "German Support in Italy"
ww1_germanrework.81.d: "To support our efforts in the Trentino mountains and lead an assault on Italy, the German Empire has sent us advisors to launch a major joint offensive. The assault is intended to push the Italians back beyond Venice and end the war in the Alps."
ww1_germanrework.81.a: "Excellent!"

ww1_germanrework.82.t: "Failure on the Italian Front"
ww1_germanrework.82.d: "The major offensive we launched against Italy failed to achieve its agreed objectives after stalling in the Alps, despite the intense efforts of our army. This strategic defeat slightly demoralized the troops, in addition to causing avoidable losses."
ww1_germanrework.82.a: "Damn!"

ww1_germanrework.108.t: "A Proposal for American Mediation"
ww1_germanrework.108.d: "With the war dragging on longer than expected and casualties mounting on both fronts, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has proposed an unorthodox initiative: appealing to the United States to mediate a peace conference between the warring powers. The hope is that President [USA.getLeader], who has remained officially neutral thus far, might be willing to bring both sides to the table.\n\nThe proposal is bold and risky. Some in the Reichstag fear it may be seen as a sign of weakness. Yet others argue that without a diplomatic breakthrough, the war could spiral into a prolonged and unwinnable struggle.\n\nBethmann Bethmann Hollweg might send a confidential communication to Washington, requesting American involvement as a neutral facilitator."
ww1_germanrework.108.a: "We must try. Send the message to Washington."
ww1_germanrework.108.b: "Too dangerous. We will not appear desperate."

ww1_germanrework.109.t: "Germany Proposes Peace Mediation"
ww1_germanrework.109.d: "A diplomatic cable has arrived from Berlin. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg, citing the deepening bloodshed in Europe, has formally requested that the United States mediate a general peace conference between the warring powers. The German government seeks what it calls 'a peace with honour' and hopes America's neutrality and moral authority will convince the Entente to come to the table.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] and his advisors are divided. Some welcome the opportunity to restore peace and affirm America's role as a global arbiter. Others are wary of German motives, suspecting this could be a ploy to solidify gains or drive a wedge between Entente powers.\n\nWhile the offer is unprecedented, the choice now lies with us: engage diplomatically, or remain at arm's length."
ww1_germanrework.109.a: "We will explore the possibility of peace."
ww1_germanrework.109.b: "This is not the right moment. Decline the request."

ww1_germanrework.110.t: "American Refusal to Mediate"
ww1_germanrework.110.d: "The response from Washington has arrived. President [USA.getLeader] has declined our request to mediate a peace conference. While carefully worded and diplomatically phrased, the message leaves no room for doubt: the United States will not intervene at this time.\n\nThe Chancellor had placed considerable hope in a neutral American initiative to bring the Entente to the negotiating table. With this door now closed, critics within the Reichstag speak of a missed opportunity and renewed calls are heard from the General Staff to prepare for a long and total war.\n\nThe situation on both fronts remains unchanged, and prospects for a diplomatic resolution grow dimmer with each passing day."
ww1_germanrework.110.a: "Then we must prepare to win the war by force."

ww1_germanrework.111.t: "America Considers Our Proposal"
ww1_germanrework.111.d: "A response from Washington has arrived. President [USA.getLeader], while cautious and clearly uncertain of our true intentions, has agreed in principle to explore the possibility of a peace conference. He has informed us that the United States is willing to act as a neutral intermediary — if the Entente is open to the idea.\n\nThough no concrete commitments have been made, this is the most promising diplomatic opening we have had since the war began. The Chancellor remains optimistic, but aware that any misstep or miscommunication may derail the process before it begins.\n\nAll now depends on how the Entente responds to the prospect of mediated negotiations."
ww1_germanrework.111.a: "Encourage the American President to proceed."

ww1_germanrework.112.t: "German Offer of Negotiations"
ww1_germanrework.112.d: "The United States has relayed a formal message from the German government. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg proposes to initiate peace talks under American mediation, offering what he describes as 'a peace with honour.'\n\nThe proposal does not include any preconditions, but its timing suggests concern within the German leadership over the war's duration and mounting losses. President [USA.getLeader] appears open to acting as facilitator, though he emphasizes that this is only a first step. Within our own ranks, opinions are divided. Some argue this may be an opportunity to secure favourable terms before further bloodshed. Others view it as a transparent ploy by Germany to consolidate its gains and weaken Allied unity.\n\nWe must now decide whether to acknowledge the offer — or reject it outright."
ww1_germanrework.112.a: "We will listen, cautiously."
ww1_germanrework.112.b: "Reject the offer. Germany must not dictate the peace."

Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg proposes to initiate peace talks under American mediation, offering what he describes as 'a peace with honour.'\n\nThe proposal does not include any preconditions, but its timing suggests concern within the German leadership over the war's duration and mounting losses. President [USA.getLeader] appears open to acting as facilitator, though he emphasizes that this is only a first step. Although we are not a major player and have no influence in these discussions, we will be informed of developments in due course."
ww1_germanrework.113.a: "We will observe with interest."

ww1_germanrework.114.t: "The Belgian Question"
ww1_germanrework.114.d: "As diplomatic efforts cautiously advance, a central question now dominates internal discussion in Washington: what stance should we adopt regarding Belgium?\n\nThe British and French insist that any acceptable peace must guarantee the full restoration of Belgian sovereignty. Public opinion in the United States, too, remains sympathetic to Belgium's plight since the 1914 invasion. But early signals from Berlin suggest that the Germans are unlikely to agree to an unconditional withdrawal.\n\nSome advisors argue we must make Belgian liberation the cornerstone of any American mediation effort — failure to do so could cost us moral authority. Others caution that issuing ultimatums too early may cause the Germans to walk away before negotiations truly begin."
ww1_germanrework.114.a: "Demand full and immediate restoration of Belgian sovereignty."
ww1_germanrework.114.b: "Treat Belgium as a central topic, but leave room to negotiate."
ww1_germanrework.114.c: "Do not raise the Belgian issue for now. Timing is everything."

ww1_germanrework.115.t: "The German Offer: Belgium for the Congo"
ww1_germanrework.115.d: "Under continued American mediation, the German government has now made its most significant concession to date: a full and unconditional withdrawal from occupied Belgian territory. In return, Germany requests the cession of Congo — currently administered by Belgium — as colonial compensation. Washington views the proposal as a balanced compromise that could end the war while satisfying core Allied demands.\n\nThe offer has stunned the Quai d'Orsay and divided the Cabinet. Some argue that Belgium's full liberation fulfills our war aims, and the Congo is ultimately a peripheral matter. Others reject the idea of rewarding aggression with imperial gain, warning that acquiescing would set a dangerous precedent — and strain Franco-Belgian relations.\n\nThe decision now rests here, in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
ww1_germanrework.115.b: "Accept. Belgium is free, and peace is within reach."
ww1_germanrework.115.a: "Reject. We will not reward German conquest."

ww1_germanrework.116.t: "The Entente Rejects Our Offer"
ww1_germanrework.116.d: "The American delegation has returned with sobering news: the Entente powers have formally rejected our proposal for a general peace settlement. Despite our commitment to a complete withdrawal from Belgium — a concession that many in Berlin deemed excessive — the Allied governments have refused to cede the Congo as compensation, denouncing the offer as an attempt to exchange imperial conquest for European withdrawal.\n\nThe Chancellor is bitterly disappointed. Within the Reichstag, opposition grows louder, and among the General Staff, voices now call for the immediate resumption of full-scale operations. The dream of a mediated peace has collapsed, and with it, any remaining illusion that the war might be ended through reason."
ww1_germanrework.116.a: "Threaten them with unrestricted submarine warfare!"
ww1_germanrework.116.b: "Then the sword must decide what diplomacy could not."

ww1_germanrework.117.t: "Germany Threatens Unrestricted Submarine Warfare"
ww1_germanrework.117.d: "A stark message has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] from Washington: the German delegation has informed President Wilson that, should the Entente continue to reject their peace overtures, Berlin will have no choice but to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The implications are grave. Such a move would target neutral shipping, including American vessels, and likely provoke U.S. entry into the war — a development the Germans appear willing to risk. The Chancellor's ultimatum is clear: accept the proposed terms, or prepare for a new phase of total war at sea.\n\nIn the Cabinet, opinions are sharply divided. Some argue that this is a desperate bluff, others see it as a calculated escalation that could shift the global balance. The future of the war may hang in the balance."
ww1_germanrework.117.a: "Let them threaten. We will not yield to blackmail."
ww1_germanrework.117.b: "This could bring America in. We must consult London."

ww1_germanrework.118.t: "France is Not Receptive"
ww1_germanrework.118.d: "Despite all the pressure our delegation has been able to exert, as well as the threat of total and unrestricted submarine warfare, the representatives of the Entente have not changed their positions and refuse to give in to our conditions, even though they are legitimate. This situation is forcing us to prolong the war, which may not work in our favor."

ww1_germanrework.119.t: "Failure of the Peace Conference"
ww1_germanrework.119.d: "Despite our best efforts to mediate a negotiated settlement, the peace initiative has collapsed. The Entente powers refused to accept the proposed terms, which included a complete German withdrawal from Belgium in exchange for colonial compensation in the Congo. France and Britain denounced the offer as morally unacceptable, and no further concessions could be obtained from Berlin. The German government, for its part, failed to exert sufficient pressure to move the talks forward, despite threatening to resume unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nWhat began as a bold diplomatic gamble has ended in deadlock. With mutual suspicion deeper than ever, and no compromise in sight, the guns will speak once more. For now, the war continues."
ww1_germanrework.119.a: "We did what we could. The world is not ready for peace."

ww1_germanrework.120.t: "The Peace Talks Collapse"
ww1_germanrework.120.d: "The American-led peace initiative has come to nothing. After weeks of confidential discussions, President [USA.getLeader] has informed our governments that Berlin will not withdraw from Belgium without receiving colonial compensation — a proposal we unanimously rejected. Germany offered to vacate Belgium only if granted the Congo, a demand we deemed outrageous and incompatible with the principles for which we fight. No further compromise has emerged, and Berlin has not delivered sufficient pressure — military or diplomatic — to force the issue.\n\nThe conference is over. While some in our governments express relief that we avoided a dishonourable settlement, others grow anxious. The war continues, with no end in sight.

Under this arrangement, we will withdraw from all occupied Belgian territory in exchange for the Congo, transferred from Belgian administration to German colonial control. While many in the General Staff bristle at the loss of a hard-fought strategic position, the Chancellor sees this as a crucial first step toward a negotiated end to the war.\n\nYet the road ahead remains long and uncertain. The questions of Alsace-Lorraine, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and naval disarmament all loom large. For now, however, we have achieved a diplomatic breakthrough, and possibly saved Germany from a war of total exhaustion."

Germany, meanwhile, insists on retaining the territory as an integral part of the Reich since 1871, warning that any concession would be politically explosive.\n\nSeveral compromise options have emerged. Some American advisors suggest a division of the provinces along cultural or linguistic lines. Others propose a neutral solution, the creation of an independent [28.getName]-[1107.getName], guaranteed by international powers. The decision will shape the next phase of the peace process — and may determine whether talks survive or collapse."

Under the mediation of President [USA.getLeader], representatives of the Central Powers and the Entente have been meeting behind closed doors to explore the conditions for ending the bloodshed.\n\nWhile no definitive settlement has been signed, sources close to the talks report a series of breakthroughs. Germany has agreed to withdraw from Belgium in exchange for colonial compensation, and the long-standing dispute over Alsace-Lorraine has now entered formal deliberations. Though fragile, the diplomatic momentum is undeniable. Some hope that the United States may yet succeed in brokering a general peace."

After consultations with Paris, President [USA.getLeader] has formally requested that Germany return the provinces of [28.getName] and [1107.getName] to France as part of a general peace settlement.\n\nThe reaction in Berlin is explosive. The Reichstag is divided between those who view this as an intolerable humiliation and those who see no path to peace without difficult concessions. The General Staff warns that abandoning the provinces would provoke unrest at home and embolden enemy demands elsewhere.\n\nChancellor Bethmann Hollweg faces a moment of truth. Refusing may shatter the fragile framework for peace. Accepting may cost the government its legitimacy.\n\nThe fate of the Reich — and the war — may turn on this decision."

ww1_germanrework.125.d: "The German government has officially communicated its willingness to cede [28.getName]-[1107.getName] to France, under the terms proposed by the American delegation.\n\nThis development marks a historic turning point. The provinces, long a source of deep animosity between France and Germany, have been at the heart of European tension for nearly half a century. That Berlin is now prepared to relinquish them is a testament to both the pressure of war and the promise of peace.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] and his advisors view this decision as a major diplomatic breakthrough. For the first time, it appears that both sides may be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a close. Much remains to be negotiated, but the path forward is clearer than ever."

The provinces, taken by force in 1871, are to return to the Republic — not through arms alone, but through relentless diplomatic and military pressure.\n\nThe announcement has sent a wave of emotion through the Chamber of Deputies and the streets of Paris. Yet it is not the end. The conditions of peace remain incomplete: the questions of the Balkans, of reparations, of disarmament — all still lie ahead.\n\nBut today, we are a step closer to justice. A step closer to victory."

ww1_germanrework.127.d: "An official note has arrived from President [USA.getLeader]'s delegation. In the interest of preserving the fragile peace process, the United States urges France to drop its claim to Alsace-Lorraine. The Americans argue that demanding the return of the provinces could derail negotiations entirely, provoke German unrest, and prolong the war. They propose alternative forms of compensation — economic, colonial, or symbolic, but make it clear that the issue is, in their view, secondary to the wider goal of peace.\n\nThe Cabinet is stunned. For millions of French citizens, Alsace and Lorraine are not a bargaining chip: they are France. To yield now would mean betraying the very cause for which our soldiers have fought and died.

ww1_germanrework.128.d: "In a move that few believed possible, the French government has officially agreed to drop its claim on Alsace-Lorraine, clearing a major obstacle in the peace process. Though the decision was met with heavy resistance in the Chamber of Deputies and the French press, President [USA.getLeader]'s insistence on compromise, and the promise of an early end to the war, ultimately persuaded Paris to make this difficult concession.\n\nThe German delegation has responded cautiously, still wary of potential conditions or future reversals. Nevertheless, Washington now sees a real opportunity to steer the negotiations toward a general armistice.\n\nThe world watches with bated breath. A conflict born out of iron and blood may yet be ended by diplomacy and restraint."
ww1_germanrework.128.a: "Peace may come at a cost — but peace is within reach."

ww1_germanrework.129.t: "America Proposes Partition of Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.129.d: "A new diplomatic note from Washington has arrived. Seeking a path between the French demand for full restitution and the German refusal to concede anything, the American delegation now proposes a territorial compromise: a partition of Alsace-Lorraine. Under this proposal, Lorraine would return to France, while Alsace — or at least a portion of it — would remain under German control. President [USA.getLeader] describes it as a 'measured and rational' solution, aimed at preserving peace and satisfying both sides.\n\nThe reaction in Paris is visceral. Many view the offer as an affront to national honor and a betrayal of our sacrifices. Others, worn down by years of war, argue that even a partial return would be preferable to continued bloodshed."
ww1_germanrework.129.a: "Unacceptable. The provinces must return whole."
ww1_germanrework.129.b: "We will consider the proposal, under protest."

ww1_germanrework.130.t: "France Rejects Partition of Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.130.d: "The French government has formally rejected our proposed compromise on the Alsace-Lorraine question. Despite our efforts to de-escalate tensions by suggesting a partition — with Lorraine returning to France and Alsace remaining under German control — Paris has issued a firm and categorical refusal.\n\nFrench officials describe the offer as 'unacceptable, both morally and historically.' The Chamber of Deputies reportedly reacted with indignation, and elements within the French press have begun questioning American neutrality. President [USA.getLeader] is now faced with a difficult choice: press on with mediation, risking a collapse of negotiations, or shift focus toward securing peace on other fronts.\n\nThe failure to resolve the Alsace-Lorraine dispute casts a long shadow over the talks."
ww1_germanrework.130.a: "Disappointing — but not the end. We will seek another path."

ww1_germanrework.131.t: "France Accepts Partition of Alsace-Lorraine"
ww1_germanrework.131.d: "After intense debate within the French government, President [USA.getLeader] has received confirmation from Paris: France will accept the proposed partition of Alsace-Lorraine, though reluctantly and under protest. Under this arrangement, Lorraine will return to France, while Alsace — or at least a portion of it — will remain under German administration. French leaders insist this is a compromise born not of satisfaction, but of exhaustion and duty to peace.\n\nThe decision has sparked protests in parts of France, and political backlash is expected. Yet diplomats in Washington view the outcome as a major step toward a comprehensive settlement. President [USA.getLeader] acknowledges the gravity of this moment — and the sacrifice it represents. The path to peace remains narrow, but it is still open."

The American delegation informs us that France, though clearly dissatisfied, has accepted the proposed compromise on [28.getName]-[1107.getName]: [1107.getName] will be ceded to France, while [28.getName] may remain within the Reich.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] now urges Germany to approve this arrangement in order to move the broader peace talks forward. Within the Reichstag and the General Staff, reactions are mixed. Some view this as a strategic victory — preserving part of the disputed territory while avoiding total concession. Others see any territorial loss as a dangerous precedent and a humiliation. The decision is now ours. Accept a compromise that ends the war on favorable terms — or refuse, and risk losing everything."
ww1_germanrework.132.a: "Agree to the partition — it preserves our interests."

ww1_germanrework.133.d: "Berlin has spoken. Despite France's reluctant acceptance of our proposed partition of Alsace-Lorraine, the German government has refused the offer outright. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's response, though couched in diplomatic language, leaves no room for ambiguity. Germany will not agree to any territorial loss in the disputed provinces, not even a partial concession. Internal reports suggest the Kaiser and General Staff view even symbolic compromise as unacceptable.\n\nThe rejection has shaken confidence in the peace process. President [USA.getLeader], who had worked tirelessly to bring both sides toward reconciliation, now faces mounting pressure at home and abroad. The Entente is furious. Paris, having sacrificed politically to accept the deal, now questions whether Germany is acting in good faith. Unless Berlin reconsiders, this could mark the end of the talks."

ww1_germanrework.134.d: "In a decision that may reshape the course of the war, the German government has officially agreed to the partition of Alsace-Lorraine as proposed by the United States. Despite fierce opposition from elements within the General Staff and the Reichstag, Berlin has accepted the compromise: Lorraine will return to France, while Alsace remains under German control. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has framed the decision as a 'painful but necessary step' toward peace.\n\nWith both France and Germany now in agreement, President [USA.getLeader] believes that an armistice on the Western Front is finally within reach. The American delegation is already preparing a formal framework for cessation of hostilities and transition toward a broader peace treaty.\n\nIt is a fragile but historic moment.

ww1_germanrework.135.t: "Breakthrough in Peace Talks"
ww1_germanrework.135.d: "The American delegation has informed us that a major breakthrough has been achieved in the ongoing peace negotiations. According to Washington, the long-disputed question of Alsace-Lorraine, which for years has stood as one of the principal obstacles to any resolution, has now been 'successfully arranged' between the concerned parties. Though details remain confidential, U.S. officials have described the outcome as 'mutually tolerable' and 'historically significant'.\n\nAs a result, talks are now moving toward the drafting of a formal ceasefire agreement on the Western Front. Should progress continue at this pace, an armistice may be declared in the coming days or weeks. Across the capitals of the Entente, a cautious sense of hope begins to replace the long-worn fatigue of war."

ww1_germanrework.136.t: "Progress in Peace Negotiations"
ww1_germanrework.136.d: "Encouraging news has arrived from Washington: the American mediators report that a major obstacle in the ongoing peace talks has now been overcome. According to the latest diplomatic communications, the issue of [28.getName]-[1107.getName] — long a source of irreconcilable tension between France and Germany — has been successfully addressed to the satisfaction of all principal parties. While the specific terms remain undisclosed, the breakthrough has created new momentum in the negotiations.\n\nWith this turning point, the prospect of a formal ceasefire on the Western Front is now being actively discussed. Further sessions are scheduled to finalize the framework of an armistice.\n\nWhile nothing is yet certain, hopes rise across the Central Powers that the end of this long and bitter war may finally be within reach."

ww1_germanrework.137.d: "In a new attempt to resolve the deadlock over [28.getName]-[1107.getName], the American delegation has presented a bold proposal: the disputed provinces would become an independent and neutral state — the Free Republic of Alsace-Lorraine — under international guarantees.\n\nPresident [USA.getLeader] argues that this solution would respect both French and German historical claims while removing the region as a permanent source of conflict. The proposal envisions a demilitarized buffer state, with its own government and symbolic neutrality.\n\nIn Berlin, reactions are divided. Some see this as a clever compromise that avoids ceding territory to France. Others regard it as a thinly veiled loss — an abandonment of sovereign land won through war and held for nearly half a century. The Reich must now decide whether to consider this path — or risk the collapse of the peace talks."
ww1_germanrework.137.a: "We accept the principle. It may preserve peace and dignity."
ww1_germanrework.137.b: "No! [28.getName]-[1107.getName] is part of the Reich and will remain so."

ww1_germanrework.138.d: "In a development few dared to expect, the German government has formally agreed to the proposal of creating an independent Alsace-Lorraine. Under this arrangement, the provinces will be transformed into a neutral and self-governing state, with its sovereignty guaranteed by the major powers. The region will be demilitarized and removed from direct French or German control — a symbolic gesture toward reconciliation.\n\nThe decision in Berlin was hard-fought. Internal resistance from military and nationalist factions was fierce, but Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg ultimately prevailed by presenting the proposal as a path to both peace and dignity. American diplomats now believe this may be the breakthrough that unlocks a general armistice on the Western Front. For the first time, the shadow of compromise eclipses the specter of total war."
ww1_germanrework.138.a: "A difficult concession, but one that may end the bloodshed."

ww1_germanrework.139.t: "Germany Rejects Alsace-Lorraine Independence"
ww1_germanrework.139.d: "The German government has formally declined our proposal to resolve the Alsace-Lorraine dispute through the creation of an independent, neutral republic. While the plan was designed to satisfy both French and German concerns, Berlin has dismissed it as an unacceptable fragmentation of sovereign territory. Sources close to the Chancellor report intense pressure from the military and conservative factions, who consider any loss — symbolic or real — of Alsace-Lorraine to be intolerable.\n\nThe rejection casts a long shadow over the peace negotiations. President [USA.getLeader] had hoped the independence model would break the deadlock between France and Germany. With that option now off the table, the future of the talks is uncertain, and the possibility of renewed hostilities looms once more.\n\nThere is still time to act — but the window is closing."
ww1_germanrework.139.a: "Then France must make concessions."

ww1_germanrework.140.t: "Germany Accepts Alsace-Lorraine Independence"
ww1_germanrework.140.d: "Word has reached Paris: under American mediation, Berlin has accepted the creation of a neutral and independent Alsace-Lorraine. The region will not return to France. Nor restera-t-elle allemande. Instead, it is to become a demilitarized republic under international guarantee, a buffer perhaps, but also a wound left only partially closed.\n\nIn the Chamber of Deputies, reactions are mixed. Some see this as a diplomatic victory — proof that Germany blinked. Others view it as a betrayal of national honor, the final sacrifice of a land reclaimed by blood in 1871 and again hoped for in this war.\n\nPublic opinion is volatile. Newspapers are cautious, veterans are furious, and the streets of Metz and Strasbourg await clarity on their future. Peace may be closer, but its price is high — and its foundations fragile."
ww1_germanrework.140.a: "We will monitor this new republic closely."

ww1_germanrework.141.t: "Reform of the Prussian Franchise Proposed"
ww1_germanrework.141.d: "Amid growing pressure from the Reichstag majority and rising social unrest, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg has presented a proposal to reform the deeply unequal electoral system of the Kingdom of Prussia. The plan would abolish the three-class voting system — which grants disproportionate power to the wealthy elite — and replace it with a more democratic and egalitarian structure, closer to the universal male suffrage used in Reichstag elections.\n\nThe proposal was designed to preserve national unity, strengthen the Chancellor's peace efforts abroad, and offer a gesture toward the Social Democrats and moderate liberals. But it has met overwhelming resistance.\n\nConservative elites, the military command, and even members of the imperial family have denounced the plan as a threat to the established order. The General Staff has privately warned the Kaiser that such reforms during wartime would 'undermine national discipline'. The proposal has not even reached the floor of the Prussian Landtag. It is dead before arrival."
ww1_germanrework.141.a: "The reform collapses under pressure. The old order holds."

ww1_germanrework.142.t: "Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg Resigns"
ww1_germanrework.142.d: "After months of mounting political pressure and repeated setbacks — both domestic and diplomatic — Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg has tendered his resignation to the Kaiser. His reform initiatives, including a proposed democratization of the Prussian electoral system, collapsed under fierce opposition from the military, conservative elites, and the imperial court. His attempts at peace mediation through Washington were equally unsuccessful, and his authority has steadily eroded.\n\nThe Supreme Army Command, led by Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, made it clear that they would no longer cooperate with Bethmann Hollweg. Facing a government crisis and fearing instability, the Kaiser accepted his resignation. Georg Michaelis, a little-known bureaucrat and loyal servant of the monarchy, has been appointed as the new Chancellor. Though lacking political experience, he is expected to follow the direction of the military leadership closely."

Our analysts report that the enemy's naval superiority, while still present, is no longer as overwhelming as it once was.\n\nThis welcome development means more of our merchant ships and neutral traders might slip through the net, bringing vital supplies. While the 'Hunger Blockade' is not broken yet, this is a significant blow to the Entente's strategy and a ray of hope for our beleaguered home front."

ww1_germanrework.144.d: "Decisive victories by the Kaiserliche Marine have shattered the Allied fleets that opposed us! With enemy naval power broken, the 'Hunger Blockade' has been effectively dismantled. Our ports are open, and the vital arteries of maritime trade can bring sustenance to the German Empire once more.\n\nThe dark days of turnip winters and meagre rations are drawing to a close. The resilience of the [GER.GetAdjective] people has been rewarded, and the home front can finally breathe easier. This triumph at sea will echo through the halls of history!"

ww1_germanrework.145.d: "A diplomatic cable from the German Foreign Office has arrived in Whitehall, bearing an unprecedented proposal: the Kaiserreich formally proposes a treaty of friendship between the German Empire and the British Crown.\n\nIn the document, Berlin emphasizes the success of recent Anglo-German understandings — the Haldane negotiations, the naval détente, and growing commercial cooperation between firms like Krupp and Vickers. Furthermore, the note references the recent joint resolution over the future of Angola, suggesting a foundation of trust has been laid.\n\nYet the implications of such a pact are immense. While it would neutralize tensions in the North Sea and potentially spare the Empire from a continental entanglement, it would also risk severing our long-standing friendship with France. Such a shift in alignment would be viewed as a betrayal in Paris, possibly fracturing the Entente entirely. The Foreign Office must now weigh the benefits of detente with Berlin against the cost of alienating our allies on the continent."
ww1_germanrework.145.a: "Accept this proposal. Peace with Germany is paramount!"

ww1_germanrework.146.d: "A formal reply has arrived from London. In a carefully worded communiqué, His Majesty’s Government has accepted the proposal for a treaty of friendship between the British Empire and the German Reich. The note highlights the fruits of recent cooperation — the success of the Haldane mission, the naval détente, and joint economic initiatives — as proof that the two great powers need not be rivals. British officials frame the accord not as an alliance, but as a commitment to neutrality and mutual respect.\n\nIn Berlin, the response is celebrated as a diplomatic coup. For the first time in decades, the possibility of a stable Anglo-German relationship seems within reach. Still, not all is calm. Paris remains silent — for now. But none doubt that this decision may shatter the very foundation of the Entente Cordiale."
ww1_germanrework.146.a: "An undeniable triumph."

ww1_germanrework.147.t: "Britain Rejects Our Proposal"
ww1_germanrework.147.d: "A formal response has arrived from the Foreign Office in London. The tone is polite, but the message is unmistakably clear: the British government has declined our proposal for a treaty of friendship. Citing historic obligations to France and concerns about the balance of power in Europe, Britain has reaffirmed its commitment to the Entente. While acknowledging recent diplomatic progress — the naval agreements, economic cooperation, and the Angola understanding — Whitehall insists that these do not warrant a shift in alignment.\n\nIn Berlin, the news is met with frustration and quiet resolve. Many had hoped that a new understanding might prevent a future collision. That hope has now dimmed. Whatever peace we had built, it seems, was never meant to endure without Paris’s approval. The diplomatic window has closed. We must prepare for the consequences."

ww1_germanrework.148.d: "In a stunning turn of diplomacy, the German Empire and the British Crown have formally signed a treaty of friendship, pledging mutual neutrality and expanded economic cooperation. The agreement, concluded after months of confidential talks and following the successful Haldane Mission, puts an end to decades of naval and imperial rivalry. \n\nObservers note the deepening ties between German and British industries, with the Vickers-Krupp partnership seen as emblematic of this new chapter. The treaty has sent shockwaves through Europe, notably the Entente. French newspapers warn of a betrayal, while Berlin hails the accord as a step toward lasting continental stability. British officials have been quick to clarify that the treaty does not constitute a military alliance, but it nonetheless marks a clear realignment of diplomatic priorities."

The civilian leadership is outraged. Not only was the decision taken unilaterally, but it also risks triggering widespread mutiny: there is little doubt that the exhausted and war-weary sailors will refuse to carry out such a suicidal mission."

These moves are designed to convince the United States that Germany is no longer an autocracy — and thus eligible for negotiations under their terms.\n\nTime is of the essence, and each delay risks more bloodshed."

The Foreign Office urges caution to avoid provoking U.S. entry into the war. But within the Admiralty and the OHL, many view any concession as weakness.

ww1_germanrework.169.d: "In a historic turn, the United States has formally declared war on the German Empire. The decision follows mounting tensions over Germany’s campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, most notably the sinking of the British liner Lusitania, which resulted in the deaths of over 100 American citizens. Despite prior diplomatic efforts, Berlin refused to scale back its operations. In Washington, President [USA.getLeader] denounced the attacks as an affront to international law and human decency."

ww1_germanrework.170.d: "Despite our warnings after the Lusitania was sunk, the German authorities seem to have resumed their unrestricted submarine warfare doctrine, which has caused the deaths of hundreds of Americans in the last few days. The vessels were all civilian ships transporting food to France and the UK, making them easy prey. In heart and mind, Germany is now a deadly enemy of the American people."

Citing their nation's sovereignty and its guaranteed neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London, they refuse to grant passage to any foreign army.\n\nTheir response is firm, stating they will defend their neutrality with all means at their disposal. This foolish pride will cost them dearly. The invasion must commence at once."

ww1_germanrework.196.t: "Passage Through Belgium Secured"
ww1_germanrework.196.d: "Our ambassador in Brussels reports that the Belgian government has yielded to our demands. Faced with the overwhelming might of the German Army and the promise of devastation, King Albert I has reluctantly agreed to grant our forces unimpeded passage through his country to strike at [FRA.GetNameDefCap].\n\nWhile they have submitted, their cooperation is born of duress, not friendship. Our forces must remain vigilant, but the strategic advantage is undeniable. The path to northern France lies open."

ww1_germanrework.197.t: "The Netherlands Defies Us"
ww1_germanrework.197.d: "A dispatch from The Hague has arrived. Despite our insistence, the government of the Netherlands has refused our request for military access. Their stubborn commitment to neutrality now stands firmly in the way of our operational plans. This defiance, while perhaps admirable to some, is an obstacle that must be dealt with."

ww1_germanrework.199.d: "The Entente has followed through on its threats. After the Dutch government bravely refused to bow to their heavy-handed ultimatum, the Entente has declared war on [HOL.GetNameDef]. In a stunning display of hypocrisy, they are now punishing the Dutch for a decision that was forced upon them, invading the very nation whose neutrality they supposedly champion.\n\nThis rash act of aggression has left the Dutch with no alternative. Seeking protection from the Entente's belligerence, [HOL.GetNameDefCap] has formally petitioned to join the Central Powers. Their armies and resources are now aligned with our own."

They promise to treat us as a friendly nation and offer generous compensation for any damages, but the unspoken threat is clear. \n\nIn response, King Albert has convened the Crown Council to determine our nation's fate. To yield would be to sacrifice our sovereignty and honour. To resist would mean war with one of the world's greatest military powers. The very existence of our kingdom is at stake."

They claim this is a necessary strategic move for their security, but it is a flagrant violation of our long-standing neutrality. To refuse means certain war with a military titan. To accept means surrendering our sovereignty and inviting the wrath of the Entente upon our soil. Our government must weigh the cost of defiance against the shame of submission."

ww1_germanrework.202.d: "We have just received intelligence that the government of [HOL.GetNameDefCap] has capitulated to a [GER.GetAdjective] ultimatum, granting their armies free passage. This act completely compromises their neutrality and poses a grave strategic threat, allowing [GER.GetNameDef] to outflank our northern defences. While they may have been coerced, their submission endangers our entire war effort. We must decide whether to forcibly intervene and treat them as a hostile power, or to accept this unfortunate reality and concentrate our forces against the primary threat."

They accuse us of abandoning our neutrality and demand that we immediately revoke Germany's military access, expel all [GER.GetAdjective] forces, and close our borders to them.\n\nThe threat is clear: if we do not comply, they will consider us an ally of the Central Powers and act accordingly. Yet, to reverse our decision now would surely invite the wrath of [GER.GetNameDefCap], which has its armies positioned right on our doorstep. We are caught between two titans, and any path we choose leads to war."

Lacking the spine to stand by their own decision, the government of [HOL.GetNameDef] has bowed to the Entente's ultimatum.\n\nThey are revoking our military access and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all our forces. This cowardly reversal throws our strategic plans for the Western Front into disarray. We must now decide how to respond to this betrayal."

ww1_german_revolution.2.d: "The revolution that began in Kiel has swept across Germany. In Berlin, massive demonstrations have paralyzed the capital. Barracks have been thrown open, arms have been distributed, and revolutionary soldiers now march beside striking workers. On [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], the Kaiser's authority vanished. Workers' and Soldiers' Councils (Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte) have seized government buildings, telegraph stations, and transport hubs. The imperial administration has collapsed. The chancellor has resigned, and power has passed - not to a parliament, but to the councils. In the streets, red flags fly.\n\nIn this dire situation, Chancellor von Baden has handed the chancellorship to Friedrich Ebert of the SPD. What comes next is unclear, but Germany is now a republic in everything but name."
ww1_german_revolution.2.a: "Can Friedrich save Germany?"

ww1_german_revolution.3.t: "Tensions Rise Between Socialists"
ww1_german_revolution.3.d: "Though the monarchy has fallen, Germany is far from united. The provisional government — a tenuous coalition between the Majority Social Democrats (MSPD) and the Independent Social Democrats (USPD) — is facing growing pressure from the radical left. The Spartacus League, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, calls for a full workers' republic on the Soviet model. Their rhetoric has become increasingly militant.\n\nMSPD leaders, including Chancellor Ebert, fear that the Spartakists may attempt to seize power by force. The USPD, though more sympathetic, is also alarmed by the possibility of an armed uprising that could plunge the country into civil war. In Berlin and other industrial centers, tensions are at a breaking point. Revolutionary councils grow more assertive, while armed Freikorps units begin to regroup. A confrontation seems inevitable unless a middle path can be found."

ww1_german_revolution.4.d: "In a clandestine telephone exchange on the evening of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], Friedrich Ebert — head of the new German government — reached a decisive understanding with General Wilhelm Groener of the Army High Command.\n\nGroener pledged the loyalty of the army to the Republic, provided that Ebert commit to preserving order and combating Bolshevik-style revolution. In return, Ebert would recognize the authority of the officer corps and ensure the continuity of the military hierarchy.\n\nThis pact, though secret, represents a profound compromise: a republic defended by imperial generals, and a socialist leader relying on monarchist officers to suppress radical workers. For Ebert, the goal is clear: the revolution must not go further. Better a republic supported by the army than chaos delivered by the Spartacists."
ww1_german_revolution.4.a: "Order must be preserved — even at this price."

# ww1_german_revolution.5.t: "The Spartacist Uprising Crushed"
# ww1_german_revolution.5.d: "What began as a strike and demonstration against the new government's cautious reforms has erupted into armed revolt. Spartacist militants, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, have occupied press buildings, set up barricades in Berlin, and declared the need for a Soviet-style republic.\n\nThe government, acting through the Council of the People's Deputies, has responded with force. Relying not only on loyal army units but also on hastily assembled right-wing Freikorps volunteers, the revolt has been brutally suppressed after days of street fighting. The cost has been immense. Hundreds are dead, including unarmed workers. Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were captured, beaten, and executed extrajudicially.\n\nThough order has returned to Berlin, the price is national division. The government has alienated much of the revolutionary left, and the alliance with nationalist paramilitaries will not soon be forgotten."
# ww1_german_revolution.5.a: "The streets are quiet again"

ww1_german_revolution.5.t: "A New Republic Is Born in Weimar"
ww1_german_revolution.5.d: "With Berlin still gripped by unrest and fresh bloodshed in the streets, the elected National Assembly has gathered in the tranquil city of Weimar. It is here, far from the chaos, that the future of the German state shall be forged. Delegates from across the fractured political spectrum — social democrats, centrists, liberals — have convened to draft a constitution, rebuild government institutions, and give the republic a legitimate foundation. Though the monarchy is gone and the empire dissolved, Germany's path remains uncertain. But from the modest halls of Weimar, a new hope rises: a republic born not of conquest or tradition, but of compromise.\n\nWhatever name history gives to this new state, its first breath is taken here — in Weimar."
ww1_german_revolution.5.a: "Let us hope it will not be called the Weimar Republic."

ww1_german_revolution.6.t: "The Republic Takes Form in Weimar"
ww1_german_revolution.6.d: "Following the historic gathering of the National Assembly in Weimar, the new German Republic is beginning to take shape. Friedrich Ebert, long a pillar of the Majority Social Democratic Party, has been elected as the first President of the Republic.\n\nAlongside him, Philipp Scheidemann has been appointed Minister-President, tasked with forming the new government and steering the country through its post-war reconstruction. Their moderate, parliamentary leadership is widely seen as a stabilizing force in these uncertain times.\n\nThough many challenges lie ahead, the formation of this civilian government marks a vital step toward democratic order."
ww1_german_revolution.6.a: "The Republic stands."

ww1_german_revolution.7.t: "Freikorps and Veterans’ Leagues Mobilize"
ww1_german_revolution.7.d: "Following the Ebert–Groener pact and amid rising fears of revolution, new military formations are emerging across Germany. Former officers, demobilized soldiers, and nationalist volunteers are organizing themselves into paramilitary units — the Freikorps.\n\nOstensibly created to protect the Republic from Bolshevik uprisings and street unrest, these formations often operate with their own agendas. At the same time, veterans’ leagues are proliferating, uniting men scarred by war in search of camaraderie, purpose — and sometimes revenge.\n\nThough useful in the short term, these forces may prove volatile in the future."
ww1_german_revolution.7.a: "Let them restore order, for now."

ww1_german_interwar.2.t: "Scheidemann Resigns Over Versailles"
ww1_german_interwar.2.d: "Philipp Scheidemann has resigned after refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles, declaring that 'such a peace is unacceptable to any honest German.' His departure reflects the profound moral and political crisis gripping the young Republic.\n\nWith the threat of resumed hostilities looming, the National Assembly has appointed Gustav Bauer to lead a new government. Tasked with the impossible — signing a treaty that most consider a betrayal — Bauer’s leadership begins under a heavy shadow."
ww1_german_interwar.2.a: "He will have to sign it."

ww1_german_revolution.8.t: "Germany Adopts a New Constitution"
ww1_german_revolution.8.d: "A new constitutional framework has been officially adopted in Germany, establishing a federal semi-presidential republic to replace the fallen imperial order. The document enshrines civil liberties, universal suffrage, and a federal structure — marking a decisive break from the past.\n\nThis step is seen by many observers as a foundation for renewed democratic governance in a nation still reeling from war, revolution, and social unrest. Whether the new republic can endure the mounting pressures it faces remains uncertain — but for now, a legal order has been restored."
ww1_german_revolution.8.a: "A republic born in troubled times."

ww1_german_revolution.16.t: "Bremen Council Republic Proclaimed!"
ww1_german_revolution.16.d: "During the revolution, a Workers' and Soldier's Council deposed the Senate of Bremen. After offering assurances for private property and soliciting the cooperation of the existing administrative bureaucracy, on the Council called an election limited to members of the left-wing parties and aligned trade unions: the Majority Social Democrats, the Independent Social Democrats, and the newly formed Communist Party of Germany. Four days later, the USPD-KPD majority declared the Bremer Räterepublik."
ww1_german_revolution.16.a: "When will they learn..."

ww1_german_revolution.9.t: "The Army Falls Apart"
ww1_german_revolution.9.d: "The revolution has not only toppled the monarchy, it has unraveled the very fabric of the army. Across the country, soldiers are abandoning their posts en masse and heading home—many still armed, many disillusioned, some radicalized. Entire regiments dissolve overnight, while barracks fall under the control of local soldiers’ councils.\n\nThe government, itself newly formed and fragile, has little authority to manage the chaos. The war is over, but no peace has been signed. Until then, there is no formal end, only a dangerous vacuum of discipline and power."
ww1_german_revolution.9.a: "We must try to hold the center… somehow."

ww1_german_revolution.10.t: "Demobilization continue in Chaos"
ww1_german_revolution.10.d: "Despite attempts by the Ebert government to control the demobilisation process, the situation remains chaotic. Train stations are flooded with returning troops, often still armed and leaderless. Desertions continue, and local councils are powerless to enforce order.\n\nMany veterans have begun to gravitate toward emerging paramilitary formations. Groups such as the Freikorps, the Stahlhelm, the Wehrwolf and the Einwohnerwehr offer structure, pay, and a sense of purpose amid the postwar confusion. While some see them as a necessary counterweight to revolutionary forces, others fear they may become a threat of their own."

 ww1_german_revolution.17.t: "Kurt Eisner Assassinated!"
 ww1_german_revolution.17.d: "In the midst of the German Revolution, [BAY.GetNameDef] was established after the overthrow of the monarchy. However, the socialist ruling party was not supported by the majority of the population, and strikes and protests were widespread. As a result, President Kurt Eisner lost the election and was shot dead by a right-wing nationalist on his way to parliament to resign.\nIn his absence, the Soviet and socialists formed a parliamentary coalition government, but within a month it was attacked by communists and anarchists, and the regime collapsed. The first chief of state to come to power was Ernst Toller."
 ww1_german_revolution.17.a: "Too much is happening to understand..."
 ww1_german_revolution.14.t: "Spartakist Uprising Put Down"
 ww1_german_revolution.14.d: "Freikorps units from the area around Berlin moved into the city, as did the Guards Cavalry Division. Berlin newspapers hailed the troops' entry at the end of the fighting as the restoration of "peace and order". The military occupation was followed by many instances of violence committed by right-wing troops, far exceeding previous acts of violence by some from the left."
 ww1_german_revolution.14.a: "Had to be done."
 ww1_german_revolution.14.b: "The Spartakists successfully flee to Munich!"

The Freikoprs deserve a great deal of credit for this."
 ww1_german_revolution.18.d_alt: "During the German revolution, Bavaria had been out of the control of the central government in Berlin for some time, but since we all have the same goal, which is the establishment of the socialist state for the sake of the workers and the people, we have now finally agreed on integration into the unified state."

GER_adressing_the_matter_of_german_identity_desc: "The debate over German national identity has persisted since the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848.

Some argue that its continued existence is necessary to ensure postwar security and suppress unrest.\n\nOthers, particularly within the Reichstag and among constitutionalists, argue that the war is over — and that the military must return to its proper place under civilian control."

The majority of the political class, and even key figures within the army, recognize that civilian leadership must be restored.

For the Reich, this is both a diplomatic overture and a strategic step to build national food reserves."

ww1_german_victory.15.t: "A Belgian Ally, Not a Subject"
ww1_german_victory.15.d: "Having renounced annexationist ambitions during the war, Germany has honored its pledge to recognize an independent Belgium. A new embassy has opened in Brussels, and economic advisors now assist in rebuilding Belgian industry. While formally sovereign, the Kingdom of Belgium finds itself under strong German influence—diplomatically, economically, and culturally. A new partnership is born, forged in the shadow of war."
ww1_german_victory.15.a: "Soft power succeeds where force failed."

ww1_german_victory.16.t: "Belgium Brought to Heel"
ww1_german_victory.16.d: "Following our wartime victory, the provisions of the Septemberprogramm are now fully enacted in Belgium. Though the country retains a nominal government, its economy is subordinated to Berlin's needs. Railways, ports, and key industries fall under German oversight. Treaties ensure military transit rights and economic privileges. Belgium is no longer an independent actor—it is a dependent satellite of the Reich."
ww1_german_victory.16.a: "Our western flank is secured—permanently."

ww1_german_victory.17.t: "A Sovereign Nation in a German Shadow"
ww1_german_victory.17.d: "Though spared annexation, Belgium emerges from the war deeply entangled with the German Empire. Berlin has opened an embassy in Brussels and deployed advisors across our ministries. Trade agreements and infrastructure programs bind our economy to theirs. While the King remains on the throne, critics warn that true autonomy may already be slipping away."
ww1_german_victory.17.a: "A fragile independence is better than none."

ww1_german_victory.18.t: "Subjugated by Treaty"
ww1_german_victory.18.d: "The war is over, but for Belgium, true peace remains elusive. Under the terms dictated by Berlin, our economy is harnessed to German needs. Railways, ports, and industries operate under foreign oversight. The Reich claims rights to transit troops and dictate key policies. Though the Belgian flag still flies, many whisper that we are but a puppet state in all but name."
ww1_german_victory.18.a: "We may have survived, but at what cost?"

ww1_german_victory.19.t: "Berlin Extends a Hand"
ww1_german_victory.19.d: "Years after our defeat, the German Empire has sent unofficial envoys proposing a diplomatic thaw. In Berlin's words, Europe must 'look forward, not backward.' Yet in France, memories of occupation, humiliation, and the Treaty of Frankfurt remain raw. The offer divides our leadership—some see opportunity, others betrayal. Can peace be built atop bitterness?"
ww1_german_victory.19.a: "We will never forget. Never."  
ww1_german_victory.19.b: "It is a bitter pill... but we shall swallow it."

ww1_german_victory.20.t: "Berlin Seeks Rapprochement"
ww1_german_victory.20.d: "A message from Berlin has arrived—carefully worded, unofficial, but unmistakable in tone. The German Empire, now stable and self-assured, wishes to restore a semblance of normal relations with Britain. Memories of the naval blockade, colonial rivalry, and wartime losses are still vivid. Parliament is divided: is this olive branch genuine diplomacy or calculated opportunism?"
ww1_german_victory.20.a: "We are not ready to forgive."  
ww1_german_victory.20.b: "For the sake of stability, we will answer."

ww1_german_victory.21.t: "A German Offer Amid the Ashes"
ww1_german_victory.21.d: "From the ruins of our civil war, a message arrives—from Berlin, no less. The German Empire proposes a diplomatic normalization, citing \"continental stability\" and \"mutual interest\". To many Russians, this is a cruel irony: Germany crushed our armies, humiliated our old regime, and now offers peace as if nothing happened. But can we afford to reject all contact with the new order?"
ww1_german_victory.21.a: "Let Berlin keep its false friendship."  
ww1_german_victory.21.b: "We answer—not out of trust, but necessity."

ww1_german_victory.22.d: "The friendly regards we addressed to the [FROM.getAdjective] Government hasnt been ignored.

It means that we might warm our relation in a more or less distant future, we hope."

ww1_german_victory.24.d: "The New Constitution has shaken the foundations of Imperial politics. With the abolition of the hated three-class voting system, conservatives are in disarray and the old order falters. The Kaiser, though reluctant, must now appoint a chancellor capable of navigating the demands of a more democratic Reichstag. He could appoint the non partisan Wilhelm Solf, which would be the more stable choice. He can also chose the die-hard reformist Erzberger or call back Hollweg, an experimented progressive."
ww1_german_victory.24.a: "Appoint Wilhelm Solf—a steady liberal hand."  
ww1_german_victory.24.b: "Return to Bethmann-Hollweg—stability above all."

Framed as a vast economic union of peace and prosperity, the proposal envisions tariff harmonization, shared infrastructure, and coordinated trade policy—all under German leadership.

ww1_german_victory.29.d: "In an effort to ease tensions following the German victory in the Great War, a delegation invited us to Tsingtau, China, to discuss a \"cooperation\" agreement between our two nations. Despite our theoretical defeat, Japan suffered few losses during the war and had, on the contrary, led an occupation of German territory in Asia. Despite this victory on paper, we were forced to withdraw from the conquered portions, which affected the government's popularity and angered the population.\n\nSigning an agreement would ease our relations, but we must be careful not to further damage Imperial honor."

ww1_german_victory.30.d1: "The Japanese delegation arrived safely in Tsingtau, and the meeting lasted three days to discuss German-Japanese relations and the status of territorial concessions following the end of the conflict. Although the discussions were constructive, the Japanese authorities refused to acknowledge German ownership of Tsingtau, arguing that the territory was under their occupation and had only been liberated for peace talks. Discussions on this subject became tense, and the final agreement therefore made no mention of this territory."
ww1_german_victory.30.d2: "The Japanese delegation arrived safely in Tsingtau, and the meeting lasted three days to discuss German-Japanese relations and the status of territorial concessions following the end of the conflict. The most contentious issue was the status of Tsingtau, a territory that the Empire of the Rising Sun had conquered during the war and had been reluctant to return in the Frankfurt Peace Treaty. Fortunately, Germany's advantageous position quickly forced the hand of the Japanese authorities, who recognized German sovereignty over the territory."

ww1_german_interwar.1.t: "Hindenburg Blames the Home Front"
ww1_german_interwar.1.d: "In a widely circulated statement, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg has broken his silence on the reasons for Germany’s defeat. According to him, the army stood firm on the front lines but was 'stabbed in the back' by unrest, strikes, and political agitation on the home front. He condemns the so-called 'Etappe'—industrialists, workers, and civilians—whom he accuses of undermining morale and national unity at a critical hour. His words resonate with conservatives—and deepen divisions within the nation."

ww1_german_interwar.3.t: "Bauer Resigns Amid Crisis"
ww1_german_interwar.3.d: "In the aftermath of the failed Kapp Putsch and under immense political pressure, Chancellor Gustav Bauer has tendered his resignation. Though his government opposed the coup, its perceived weakness during the crisis sparked outrage across the political spectrum. To restore credibility, the Kaiser has appointed Hermann Müller—a Social Democrat with a more moderate reputation—as the new Reichskanzler. Whether he can navigate the storm remains to be seen."
ww1_german_interwar.3.a: "A fragile republic clings to stability."

ww1_german_interwar.4.t: "Collapse of the Weimar Coalition"
ww1_german_interwar.4.d: "The recent elections have brought an end to the so-called Weimar Coalition, as the SPD, DDP, and Zentrum fail to maintain their parliamentary majority. Chancellor Hermann Müller, unable to secure continued support, has resigned. In his place, the president has appointed Constantin Fehrenbach, a centrist Catholic statesman, to lead the Reich. His task will be to hold together a fragmented Reichstag and rebuild confidence in civilian governance."

ww1_german_interwar.5.d: "The Entente has issued an ultimatum from London: Germany must accept the obligation to pay 132 billion gold marks in reparations. The sum is staggering—impossible to repay without plunging the nation into economic ruin. Across the Reich, outrage spreads. Politicians speak of national humiliation, industrialists warn of collapse, and citizens protest what they call a 'tribute, not peace'. Yet rejection may lead to renewed occupation or even war."
ww1_german_interwar.5.a: "This is extortion, not justice."

ww1_german_interwar.6.t: "Plebiscites in East Prussia and Silesia"
ww1_german_interwar.6.d: "As mandated by the Treaty of Versailles, plebiscites were held in East Prussia and Upper Silesia to determine their future allegiance. Despite Polish agitation and unrest, a majority in several contested regions voted to remain within the Reich. While some border adjustments may still follow, the result is seen as a political and moral victory in Berlin. Crowds celebrate in Königsberg and Breslau—but tensions remain high along the frontier."

Supported by volunteers from across the border, they aim to force international intervention and alter the final settlement. German Freikorps and local militias mobilize in response. The region descends into chaos, threatening to undo fragile diplomatic gains."

 ww1_german_interwar.15.t: "[GetMonth] Action"
 ww1_german_interwar.15.d: "Inspired by revolutionary zeal and unrest among workers in central Germany, the Communist Party (KPD) has launched an armed uprising. Strikes, sabotage, and open conflict erupt across Saxony and Thuringia. Yet the revolt is poorly coordinated, lacks popular support, and is crushed within days by police and Reichswehr units. The failed rebellion deepens divisions on the left—and strengthens calls for a crackdown on radicalism."
 ww1_german_interwar.15.a: "The Red dream burns out—again."

ww1_german_interwar.9.t: "The Third Silesian Uprising"
ww1_german_interwar.9.d: "Despite prior agreements and plebiscite results showing over 60% support for remaining in Germany, Polish insurgents have launched a third uprising in Upper Silesia. The League of Nations proposes a territorial compromise to prevent escalation. Berlin now faces a choice: accept a painful division of the region, or act unilaterally to crush the rebellion and reassert sovereignty by force."

With the monarchy crumbling and the Kaiser in exile, Germany finds itself with two visions of the future—and no clear path forward."

ww1_german_revolution.12.d: "Tensions exploded in Berlin when government forces attempted to disband the Volksmarinedivision, a leftist militia occupying the Berlin Palace. The marines refused to stand down, leading to street battles, deaths, and a humiliating retreat of loyal troops. Ebert's government survives, but trust between the SPD and the radical left is shattered. The young Republic now teeters on the edge of civil war."

ww1_german_interwar.8.d: "Following the chaos of the Third Silesian Uprising and mounting Polish pressure, the League of Nations has ruled in favor of transferring a part of Upper Silesia region to Poland. The decision is hailed in Warsaw as a diplomatic victory and a step toward national unification. However, German protests are growing louder, and the region’s mixed population may yet turn this gain into a new source of conflict."

Such was the popularity of Hitler's speaking skills, the party began charging an entry fee for visitors to hear his speeches.\n\nThe small number of party members were quickly won over to Hitler's political beliefs. He organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people in a beer hall in Munich. Further in an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party."

 ENG_Staff_desc: "The British Army during the Great War could trace its organisation to the increasing demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of recruitment and the regimental system, which had been defined by the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon for Empire matters and the ensuing colonial wars. In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899-1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration. "

 PER_idea_rural_society: "Rural Society"
 PER_idea_rural_society_desc: "Persia, dwarfed in comparison to the economies of the European and American nations, and cursed with political instability, is in a difficult position to modernise. The rapid decline has distracted the Persian nation from adapting its agrarian economy, and with it comes the cost of heavy economic reliance and a lack of infrastructure to industrialise from. And while the Persian army does not suffer from this as much as it logically should due to the military missions sent by the European powers, Persia is left completely vulnerable to invasion due to its lack of an industrial base, even from tribes inside of its borders. The revolutionary instability has already done grave harm to the integrity and glue of the nation, and this lack of centralisation is the cherry on top of Persia's problems."

 PER_idea_constitutional_revolution_desc: "The 20th century had not been merciful to Persia. From what the constitutionalists perceive, Persia had been a nation stuck in time with its reactionary regime opposing all reform. King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, the monarch up to 1906, had signed a constitution shortly before his passing. The succession turned to Mohammed Ali Shah, who then went on to abolish the constitution and bomb the parliament building. Pro-constitutional elements then went on to force his abdictation and reestablish the constitution, but not without its harm to the integrity of the nation. After a destabilising civil war and foreign interventions, Persia now stands at the crossroads of history. Facing political decay and disorder, whoever succeeds is completely up to the sands of time."
 PER_idea_foreign_reliance: "Foreign Reliance"
 PER_idea_foreign_reliance_desc: "Throughout the long century, the Russian Empire and the British Empire, currently in the middle of the Great Game, looked to Persia as a chess piece. From its geographic location, Persia was seen by both nations as a buffer zone against the other. Persia, if controlled by the British, would expose Russia's underbelly, that is the Caucasus and Central Asia. Were it to be under Russian control, it would cut through the British Empire, exposing Kuwait and Baluchistan. The Persian diplomats, eager to exploit this prospect, wanted to use this cold war to secure Persian independence by playing both sides against each other. This foreign policy strategy, however, failed tremendously, following the softening of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire."

According to the Megali Idea, the Greek nation must gather up strength to liberate Greek inhabited territories under foreign rule, with its final goal being the liberation of the former Eastern Roman capital, and cultural centre of the Hellenes, Constantinople. When  George I ascended the throne in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was not \"King of Greece\", the title of his deposed predecessor, King Otto; but rather \"King of the Hellenes\". Forward to that, the kingdom saw a rapid expansion over the decades, with the annexation of the Ionian Islands under the Treaty of London in 1864 and the annexation of Thessaly and Arta under the Convention of Constantinople in 1881.

However, this mobility comes at the cost of heavy equipment and infrastructure, limiting their capacity for sustained engagements and logistical support."

 EGY_british_colonial_interference_desc: "Established under the pretext of maintaining stability and order, British colonial rule has undermined Egyptian sovereignty and curtailed the authority of the Khedive. While the British aim to secure their economic interests, such as control over the Suez Canal and cotton exports, their heavy-handed tactics provoke widespread resentment among the Egyptian populace. This colonial interference fosters a growing nationalist sentiment, as many Egyptians yearn for self-determination and a government free from foreign control"
 EGY_nahda: "Nahda"
 EGY_nahda_desc: "The Nahda, or ''Awakening,'' represents a significant cultural and intellectual revival in Egypt, characterized by a flourishing of literature, arts, and education that seeks to redefine Egyptian identity and promote modernization. Influenced by Western thought and ideas, Egyptian intellectuals, poets, and writers, such as Ahmad Shawqi and Hafez Ibrahim, are at the forefront of this renaissance, encouraging critical discourse and national pride. As schools and universities expand access to education, a new generation of politically aware citizens emerges, advocating for reforms and greater autonomy from colonial rule. This cultural awakening serves as a powerful catalyst for Egyptian nationalism, laying the groundwork for future movements seeking self-determination and independence."
 EGY_veiled_protectorate: "Veiled Protectorate"
 EGY_veiled_protectorate_desc: "Since 1882, when the Urabi Pasha's attempt at self-rule in Egypt was crushed by British intervention, Egypt has been in the strange position of being a de jure autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, but de facto under British political, economic and diplomatic control. Technically, the Khedive is supposed to be appointed by Kostantiniyye, but in practice this is not the case. The Khedivate is nothing more than a protected state of the British Empire."

 VEN_foreign_debt: "Foreign Debt"
 VEN_foreign_debt_desc: "Under the reckless administration of Cipriano Castro, Venezuela’s national finances were mismanaged, leading to skyrocketing foreign debt and international tensions.

When Juan Vicente Gómez took power, he inherited this burden and was forced to take drastic measures to stabilize the economy. Gómez worked to negotiate with creditors and impose fiscal discipline, but the heavy debt still looms large over the nation's future, constraining domestic development and fueling resentment among the populace."

 SPR_carlism: "Carlism"
 SPR_carlism_desc: "Rooted in loyalty to the Bourbon Carlist line and a vision of a more conservative, Catholic, and decentralized Spain, Carlism has many sparked civil wars in the past and remains a potent force of dissent. While the Carlists have been largely driven to the political fringes, their support persists among rural communities, especially in Navarre, the Basque Country, and Aragon. Their calls for a return to monarchy under their pretender and their rejection of liberalism and centralism continue to challenge the stability of the Spanish State"

 SPR_clericalismo: "La Iglesia"
 SPR_clericalismo_desc: "The Catholic Church wields immense influence over Spanish society, shaping not just spiritual life but also education, culture, and politics. From the pulpit to the halls of power, the Church serves as a cornerstone of the nation, championing conservative values and acting as a bulwark against liberalism, socialism, and other perceived threats to tradition. Its dominance is most evident in rural communities, where priests hold sway over daily life and the populace sees the Church as a moral guide."

He also excommunicated the King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, and the entire House of Savoy, and refused any dialogue with the Kingdom of Italy.

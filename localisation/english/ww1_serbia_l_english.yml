The more conservative Old Radicals make up the bulk of Serbias parliament, and thus hold the most influence in the coalition.

ww1_serbia.1.t: "Opposition Candidate Found Dead in Krusevac"
ww1_serbia.1.d: "Local authorities today have discovered the dead body of a well known local politician aligned with the Progressive Party. Mijatovic, in a speech to parliament, has called for an investigation into the matter to be conducted. The measure has been blocked by members of the dominant Old Radical party however, who say the matter is not the business of parliament and must be decided by courts. Credible claims are putting the blame on the Radical Party for the murder."

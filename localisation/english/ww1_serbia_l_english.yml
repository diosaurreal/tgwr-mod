The coalition is enthusiastically backed by King Peter, who sees it as stabilizing the political situation in Serbia. The more conservative Old Radicals make up the bulk of Serbias parliament, and thus hold the most influence in the coalition. The Old Radicals will, however, have to make concessions to the Independent radicals to keep the government going.§!"

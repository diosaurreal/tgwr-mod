# Economic Branch #

DEN_the_magic_rock: "The Magic Rock"
DEN_the_magic_rock_desc: "Coal has fueled our industry for decades. We must seek a source for consistent access to it, lest we find ourselves back in the Middle Ages."
DEN_maintain_butter_economics: "Maintain Butter Economics"
DEN_maintain_butter_economics_desc: "Our economy primarily depends upon the export of dairy products, namely butter, and pork products, typically bacon. The United Kingdom has so far been our biggest trading partner in this regard, and we should seek to continue this relationship."
DEN_further_economic_entente: "Further Economic Ties to Entente"
DEN_further_economic_entente_desc: "Britain has grown increasingly close with the French Republic and the Russian Empire; perhaps we should follow their stride and begin trading with the two as well. More markets means more competition, which means more money, after all."
DEN_british_coal: "British Coal"
DEN_british_coal_desc: "Historically, Danish coal overwhelmingly comes from British mines, and we see no reason for this to differ at all. With our continuation of close economic ties to them, why would we?"
DEN_bringing_home_bacon: "Bringing Home the Bacon"
DEN_bringing_home_bacon_desc: "Bacon is another key component of Danish export economics, and regardless of whatever happens, the oods are quite good it remains there."
DEN_new_creameries: "New Creameries"
DEN_new_creameries_desc: "Butter is great and all, but buttermilk, cream, yogurt, and other dairy products can also bring us great value, even if it's limited to the immediate area around us."
DEN_ease_of_access: "Ease of Access"
DEN_ease_of_access_desc: "By ensuring major economies, namely in the form of Britain, America, and Germany, have access to our products, it means we can better sell them."
DEN_expand_mechanization: "Expand Mechanization"
DEN_expand_mechanization_desc: "Farming and agriculture in general is a very manpower-intensive field of labor, and by purchasing tractors and seeking the means to produce them domestically, we can create jobs, expand our domestic industry, and improve productivity by a large margin."

DEN_europes_dairy_store: "Europe's Dairy Store"
DEN_europes_dairy_store_desc: "Denmark serves a great purpose as the provider of a great deal of Europe's dairy in some way. We are proud of that fact, and we should seek to entrench and expand that with new products and more volume."
DEN_TSOL_grain: "The Grain Crisis"
DEN_TSOL_grain_desc: "American grain has begun to flood into the Danish market. We must resolve a way to ensure our economy doesn't collapse from the sheer amount of it."
DEN_utilize_international_grain: "Utilize International Grain"
DEN_utilize_international_grain_desc: "By utilizing American grain, we can feed our livestock and ourselves for dirt cheap, meaning our profit margins can skyrocket."
DEN_utilize_cheap_grain: "Utilizing Cheap Grain"
DEN_utilize_cheap_grain_desc: "Perhaps we can purchase grain that isn't fit for human consumption, yet not rotten or infested with bugs or mold, and use it in some other way."
DEN_feed_the_feed_plants: "Feeding the Feed Plants"
DEN_feed_the_feed_plants_desc: "Cheap poor-quality grain has found a new home: feed plants. By turning this subpar grain that would otherwise go to waste into a viable product, we can not only sell it for massive profits but expand our industrial ability."
DEN_economic_neutrality: "Economic Neutrality"
DEN_economic_neutrality_desc: "Some say a war looms overhead, and we cannot afford to fight such a conflict. By enshrining our neutrality, we can sell to all sides in this potential Great War."
DEN_explore_german_markets: "Explore German Markets"
DEN_explore_german_markets_desc: "Germany has remained an underutilized space for Danish exports for a variety of reasons. Perhaps by creating a deal with Berlin, we can get industrial aid in exchange for our foodstuffs."

DEN_a_new_meal: "A New Meal"
DEN_a_new_meal_desc: "Dairy and bacon alone cannot sustain the Danish economy, as Europe begins to look to America for cheap foodstuffs. As such, we are electing to expand our horizons, preparing a new course of meals to satiate Europeans and their endless appetite."
DEN_replicate_sweden: "Replicate Sweden"
DEN_replicate_sweden_desc: "Sweden has partially fixed their coal issue by creating charcoal, albeit they're able to do this with their vast forests. If we can reach an agreement with places like Russia, America, and, of course, Sweden, maybe we can allievate some of our issues and create more jobs."
DEN_new_markets: "New Markets"
DEN_new_markets_desc: "Britain alone cannot sustain our economy. We must diversify, and we must look to new places, in whatever form that may take."
DEN_can_we_can: "Can we Can?"
DEN_can_we_can_desc: "Canning goods are a very good way to preserve such things as vegetables, fruit, meat, and even dairy. It's an interesting proposition to look into, and perhaps we should start encouraging the private firm to go into it."

DEN_shifting_priorities: "Shifting Priorities"

DEN_promote_domestic_grain: "Promote Domestic Grain"
DEN_promote_domestic_grain_desc: "American grain is a threat to our farmers, and while we can certainly see the usage in it, we can't risk losing the support of our rural base. We must encourage Danes to buy local."
DEN_introduce_grain_tariffs: "Introduce Grain Tariffs"
DEN_introduce_grain_tariffs_desc: "While not entirely popular, the concept of a grain tariff isn't a bad idea, especially if we want to support our farmers. Even a small one could give us a lot of money to use elsewhere, too, so perhaps this may counteract any downsides?"
DEN_national_granary: "A National Granary?"
DEN_national_granary_desc: "A granary may be required due to our recent tariffs, just in case a crisis hits, like drought or a volcano eruption. This will eat slightly into our funds, of course, but we'd rather be safe than sorry. It'll also likely stabilize produce prices."

DEN_export_en_masse: "Export en Masse"
DEN_export_en_masse_desc: "Export en Masse"
DEN_patriot_pigs: "Patriot Pigs"
DEN_patriot_pigs_desc: "Also known as the Danish Protest Pig, the breed was created out of protest against Prussian (and later German) bans on flying Danish flags. We should encourage Danes to breed these pigs, both in our realm and internationally."
DEN_expand_maritime_shipping: "Expand Maritime Shipping"
DEN_expand_maritime_shipping_desc: "Denmark is a country made up of islands, and due to our strategic location between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, we must invest in shipping to ensure we don't fail to export our foods."
DEN_distribute_russian_grains: "Distribute Russian Grains"
DEN_distribute_russian_grains_desc: "With our dedication to ensuring the flow of goods through the Belts, an interesting opportunity has presented itself. Russia has a surplus of grain that we could use for a variety of things, including selling it to the West."
DEN_overseas_resources: "Overseas Resources"
DEN_overseas_resources_desc: "Overseas Resources"

DEN_expand_fishing_docks: "Expand Fishing Docks"
DEN_expand_fishing_docks_desc: "Fish is a very easy way to feed someone; after all, there's a popular saying concerning it. By investing into local piers and docks, as well as subsidies and tax cuts for new companies to fish for the realm, we can expand our industry by becoming fish-mongers."
DEN_belt_trout: "Belt Trout"
DEN_belt_trout_desc: "Trout are abundant in the seas surrounding the Danish Belts. With our newfound fishing fleet, we can make use of this to feed our people and export for profits."
DEN_fishing_accords: "Fishing Accords"
DEN_fishing_accords_desc: "Who owns what in the seas has been a question for centuries, and we cannot afford to ask it and be answered with war or sanctions. We must reach an agreement concerning territorial waters and fishing rights."
DEN_icelandic_cod: "Icelandic Cod"
DEN_icelandic_cod_desc: "Cod is abundant around Iceland, and with a deal reached with the United Kingdom, we can fish to our stomach's content."
DEN_icelandic_lumber: "Icelandic Lumber"
DEN_icelandic_lumber_desc: "Iceland doesn't have many minerals for exploitation, but they do have a huge potential to give us lumber, something we desperately need for construction and industry. By investing into the island, we can reap the rewards."
DEN_greenlandic_halibut: "Greenlandic Halibut"
DEN_greenlandic_halibut_desc: "Greenland is largely underpopulated and underutilized, but those who live there overwhelmingly fish. Shrimp and other crustaceans are a large factor in this, but halibut is more fitting for the European diet." 
DEN_greenlandic_cyrolite: "Greenlandic Cyrolite"
DEN_greenlandic_cyrolite_desc: "Cyrolite, in short, is a very useful mineral that has historically been used to make hydrofluoric acid. Ivittuut has so far been the only place on Earth known to naturally hold it, and if refined properly can produce aluminium, an increasingly important mineral. We should invest heavily the mine and the forges required to make this magic metal."
DEN_faroe_salmon: "Faroe Salmon"
DEN_faroe_salmon_desc: "The Faroe Islands don't have much going for them, despite their beauty and strategic location. But they do have salmon, and with agreements from Britain we can seek to exploit this for our own good."
DEN_faroe_wool: "Faroe Wool"
DEN_faroe_wool_desc: "The Faroes also have lots and lots of sheep, and by investing in local fabric plants, we can support this industry and cut down on international imports of wool."
DEN_west_indian_grouper: "West Indian Grouper"
DEN_west_indian_grouper_desc: "The Danish West Indies are barely of any use to us, being very underpopulated. But the Caribbean is full of delicious fish, and the grouper is one of many. We should expand the local docks and encourage companies to run fleets there."
DEN_west_indian_rum: "West Indian Rum"
DEN_west_indian_rum_desc: "Rum is a relatively simply alcohol to refine, and the nearby Caribbean provides more than enough sugar for it. We can open up a local refinery or two for export back to the mainland, and rival the German schnapps."
DEN_realmwide_fishery: "Realmwide Fisheries"
DEN_realmwide_fishery_desc: "With our newfound world-wide fishing fleet, we can now easily establish local fisheries to reliably sustain the fish population so we don't encounter a dodo-like extinction event with them."
DEN_realmwide_industry: "Realmwide Industry"
DEN_realmwide_industry_desc: "Likewise, we can open up mills and factories across the realm for the refinement and export of our new-found wealth."

DEN_rural_industry: "Rural Industry"
DEN_rural_industry_desc: "Grain silos, slaughterhouses, feed plants, creameries, and flour mills are all very useful in a rural-dominated country such as ours, and by placing them in strategic areas for ease of access to them, we can bolster our economy greatly."
DEN_urban_industry: "Urban Industry"
DEN_urban_industry_desc: "Alternatively, the urban sector is fast growing, and by investing heavily there with similar jobs, we can create a more centralized kind of economy that may later spread out into the countryside."
DEN_expanding_the_creameries: "Expanding the Creameries"
DEN_expanding_the_creameries_desc: "'Butternomics' is only growing, and supply is not meeting demand. Naturally, we should ensure that doesn't happen again by expanding our plants dedicated to the dairy industry."
DEN_expanding_the_canneries: "Expanding the Canneries"
DEN_expanding_the_canneries_desc: "Our canned goods are, surprisingly, popular with people across Europe, and we're running out of tin cans to shove things into. But this isn't for a lack of steel, we don't have the buildings or equipment to do it; we need to fix that immediately."
DEN_europes_grocer: "Europe's Grocer"
DEN_europes_grocer_desc: "Europe increasingly looks to us and America for their food, and while we can't compete with Uncle Sam when it comes to quantity or price, we're very close and very high quality, and we should capitalize on that image. We shall become Europe's Grocer, or at the very least the corner store."

DEN_subsidize_railways: "Subsidize Railways"
DEN_subsidize_railways_disc: "Subsidize Railways"
DEN_invest_in_ferries: "Investing in Ferries"
DEN_invest_in_ferries_desc: "Investing in Ferries"

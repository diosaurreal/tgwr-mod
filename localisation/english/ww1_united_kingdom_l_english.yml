ww1_united_kingdom.1.t: "Asquith Petitions the King"
ww1_united_kingdom.1.d: "Earlier today the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, visited Buckingham Palace to ask the King to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. As expected of the King, he agreed to his Prime Minister's request and soon the elections will be announced the government.\n\nThe reasoning behind Asquith's request, lies in the fact that the Prime Minister needs a new mandate from the people to rally support in order to reform the privileges of the House of Lords, who have consistently blocked Asquith's attempts to implement home rule, new budgets or a multitude of social reforms. However, the Liberal Party's position in parliament is far from stable, forced into a coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party whilst only being a few seats ahead of the Conservative Party - they may lose this election, especially with the rise of the Labour Party on the horizon which has slowly chipped away at the Liberal's support on the left.\n\nThe Liberal Party has many obstacles ahead of its victory, and many more after that too. In times like this where Europe is dividing itself into factions, the empire must have a strong government to ensure the nation stays intact."
ww1_united_kingdom.1.a: "Good luck, Mr Prime Minister"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.t: "Asquith Requests the Appointment of New Liberal Peers"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.d: "Asquith's ambitions to reform the House of Lords rely heavily on the fact he can actually pass a parliament bill, obviously in the current state this would be impossible to pass through both chambers of government. Therefore the Prime Minister once again visited Buckingham Palace, this time to ask the King to mass appoint an adequate number of Liberal peers to carry the Parliament Bill once he had won the election. The King's late father, Edward VII had already rejected this proposal but in the interest of securing a stable government under the Liberals, and in the interest of the democratic mandate given by the people, it may be time to adhere to Asquith's demand.\n\nUnlike Asquith's ask to dissolve parliament, the King is well within his right to reject the Prime Minister's demands. However, the Liberal Government has threatened to resign if the King should refuse, forcing the King to call on the Conservative Party leader, Arthur Balfour to form a new minority government."
ww1_united_kingdom.2.a: "The King agrees"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.b: "The King refuses, let Asquith resign and summon Balfour"
ww1_united_kingdom.3.t: "The Government Announces a General Election"
ww1_united_kingdom.3.d: "The Liberal government under Prime Minister Asquith has announced to the nation that a general election will soon be held. The primary candidates are H. H. Asquith leading the Liberal Party and Arthur James Balfour leading the Conservative Party. This will be the second election of 1910 and will either cement Asquith's mandate or see a new Conservative government that will surely seek to reverse the social reform brought about under the previous administration."
ww1_united_kingdom.3.a: "Onwards to Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.4.t: "Liberal Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.4.d: "The results from the election are in, and we the Liberal Party have once again been given a democratic mandate from the British people. Once again we have been forced into a coalition with the IPP, meaning that once we have reformed the House of Lords, securing home rule must be a great priority of our government. H. H. Asquith continues his time as Prime Minister once again, only history shall know whether our task will turn out to be successful."
ww1_united_kingdom.4.a: "A cause for celebration"
ww1_united_kingdom.5.t: "Conservatives Begin Their Election Campaign"
ww1_united_kingdom.5.d: "The Conservative Party has begun its election campaign. Under the leadership of Balfour, they seem to be running a relatively unified campaign, much to our dismay, as it's blatantly obvious that in terms of party stability, the Conservatives take the lead on this matter.\n\nBalfour has made key points on tariff reforms and is campaigning hard against our social reforms, as well as the previous 'people's budget'."
ww1_united_kingdom.5.a: "We'd do best to follow suit"
ww1_united_kingdom.6.t: "Balfour Criticises Our Proposed Reforms"
ww1_united_kingdom.6.d: "Arthur Balfour, the leader of the Conservative Party, has recently focused his campaign efforts on criticising the possible effects of our proposed Parliament bill that would limit the power of the House of Lords.\n\nBalfour has called his bill an attack on personal wealth, and something that would radically alter the British constitution, going so far as to brand us as radicals who would do away with the two-chamber system. Admittedly, if we could demolish the House of Lords, it would make our job rather easy... Nonetheless his message has resonated with much of the electorate."
ww1_united_kingdom.6.a: "We won't give these lies merit through response."
ww1_united_kingdom.6.b: "Counter by highlighting the conservative stranglehold."
ww1_united_kingdom.7.t: "Labour on the Rise"
ww1_united_kingdom.7.d: "With the increase in strike action, the common people of Britain have been moved further and further left in recent years. The socialist labour party is the fastest-growing party in England, supported by the unions and holding the third largist minority in parliment. It seems inevitable that the labour party will continue to grow, one can hope this nonsense will die down eventually and a majority government can be formed."
ww1_united_kingdom.7.a: "Surely people can see this as the folly it is?"
ww1_united_kingdom.8.t: "Irish Nationalism on the Rise"
ww1_united_kingdom.8.d: "The Irish vote has been signficantly been swayed by the matter of home rule, whishing for the people of Ireland to have more representation for their own affairs. The IPP is a moderate party, whishing to ensure home rule in Ireland by working with the British parliment. Whilst this rise is expected, it doesn't help our chances at securing a electoral majority."
ww1_united_kingdom.8.a: "Will the Irish matter ever be resolved?"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.t: "Conservatives Fearmonger the State of the Empire"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.d: "With Britain being put back onto the European stage by our government, with the signing of the Entente Cordiale, it has sparked many questions on how our already overextended empire will cope. The conservatives have used this to criticise our government by claiming that we are risking the empire through inadequate government."
ww1_united_kingdom.9.a: "More lies that don't warrant a response"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.b: "Campaign for Imperial Stability"
ww1_united_kingdom.10.t: "Conservatives Finalise their Campaign"
ww1_united_kingdom.10.d: "The Conservatives have ended their campaign, just a few days before the end of the election trail. Conservatives across the nation are now hopeful for a victory in Parliament. We still have some time left to counter the conservative campaign."
ww1_united_kingdom.10.a: "We're sure to win this"
ww1_united_kingdom.11.t: "Conservative Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.11.d: "The election results are in, the conservatives have been given a new mandate from the people! Arthur Balfour has been invited by the King to meet him at Buckingham Palace where Balfour will be asked to form a government in his majesty's name. This new conservative government will face significant problems due to their minority in parliament and inability to form a coalition - only time will tell if they can survive. Their first challenge will be to gather support in parliament based on the goodwill of MPs to pass a vote of confirmation, which will allow the conservatives to rule without holding a majority of parliament's seats through a coalition."
ww1_united_kingdom.11.a: "Time to turn Britain around!"
ww1_united_kingdom.12.t: "The Government Resigns"
ww1_united_kingdom.12.d: "With the King refusing Asquith's demand to expand with the House of Lords through the mass appointment of new liberal peers, the current government has resigned. Soon after this announcement, Arthur Balfour, the leader of the conservative party, was summoned by the King and invited to form a new government. This new conservative government will face significant problems due to their minority in parliament and inability to form a coalition - only time will tell if they can survive. Their first challenge will be to gather support in parliament based on the goodwill of MPs to pass a vote of confirmation, which will allow the conservatives to rule without holding a majority of parliament's seats through a coalition."
ww1_united_kingdom.12.a: "Balfour can do it! Right?"
ww1_united_kingdom.13.t: "Liberal Support and the King's Opening of Parliment"
ww1_united_kingdom.13.d: "Our new Conservative government is unable to form a willing coalition with any other party in parliament. It therefore must rely on the goodwill of individual MPs in parliament to stay in power. Luckily for us, the leader of the Liberal Party, and former Prime Minister, Herbert Henry Asquith, has endorsed our government and hence recommended to his party that they keep faith in this new government. The support of Asquith has ensured the success of our initial government. Tomorrow the King will open the parliament and the true work of our government will begin. It will be an upward battle from here on out to keep our party in government."
ww1_united_kingdom.13.a: "Now we must ensure parliment continues to support our government"

ww1_united_kingdom.16.t: "Britain Proposes a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.16.d: "The British parliament has extended an invitation to commit to a joint training mission between our two armies. The mission would consist of a multitude of standard exercises between the two, with the intention of keeping our armed forces up to date and better the coordination between our two forces."
ww1_united_kingdom.16.a: "Naturally!"
ww1_united_kingdom.16.b: "What a waste of our time"
ww1_united_kingdom.17.t: "France Agrees to a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.17.d: "As expected, the French government has agreed to our proposal and soon our armed forces will embark on a joint training mission."
ww1_united_kingdom.17.a: "It'll be some good practice for the boys"
ww1_united_kingdom.18.t: "France Refuses our Offer of a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.18.d: "To the confusion of many in the British government, it seems the French have declined our request to commit to a joint training mission. The reasons why are unknown, all we have is the vauge excuses from the French Foreign Minister."
ww1_united_kingdom.18.a: "Huh?"
ww1_united_kingdom.19.t: "The Liberal Party Breaks Rank"
ww1_united_kingdom.19.d: "Due to the failure of Prime Minister Asquith to retain his electoral promises, the liberal party, under the influence of David Lloyd George has called for Prime Minister Asquith to resign or else the party would commit to revolt against the Prime Minister and hence would be left without an able government. With no choice but to resign, Asquith has announced his resignation to the general public and a new Prime Minister would be chosen by the Liberal Party."
ww1_united_kingdom.19.a: "For Christ's Sake"
ww1_united_kingdom.20.t: "A New Prime Minister Chosen"
ww1_united_kingdom.20.d: "With the resignation of Asquith the Liberal party has had to decide who should take over his mandate and form a new cabinet. There was little debate to be had, David Lloyd George was already the frontman for the party even during Asquith's term as Prime Minister. After Lloyd George himself led the calls for Asquith's resignation it was clear who the next Prime Minister was going to be.\n\nEarlier this day, the King called on David Lloyd George to Buckingham Palace, where Lloyd George was formally invited to form a new government and the two discussed the business of forming a new cabinet to govern the nation."
ww1_united_kingdom.20.a: "Good Luck!"

ww1_united_kingdom.22.t: "The Home Rule Bill"
ww1_united_kingdom.22.d: "The Third Home Rule Bill proposed by Asquith has passed House of Commons and is now moving onto the House of Lords, however, the conservative dominated House of Lords is very unlikely to allow the bill to go any further."
ww1_united_kingdom.22.a: "Them damned conservatives!"
ww1_united_kingdom.23.t: "Results of the Home Rule Vote"
ww1_united_kingdom.23.d: "The Third Home Rule Bill has failed to pass the House of Lords after conservative opposition to the bill blocked it. Asquith will now have to propose a second bill to get this through."
ww1_united_kingdom.23.a: "Time to propose it again"
ww1_united_kingdom.24.t: "Second Home Rule Bill Attempt"
ww1_united_kingdom.24.d: "The Third Home Rule Bill is on its second attempt, passing parliament easily just like the last one but it's now moving onto the conservative House of Lords. It seems very unlikely it will pass, however, if it fails and we propose it again and the House of Lords rejects it again, we will be able to override the House of Lords."

The UVF bought the SS Clyde Valley to avoid authorities over the SS Fanny's incident in Denmark and loaded the arms onto the SS Clyde Valley, which was then destined to Larne harbour as the UVF had another ship distract the authorities in Belfast lough. The SS Clyde successfully made it to Larne harbour, where it transported the arms to 2 other ships which then transported them to motor vehicles."

ENG_1910_elections_desc: "The government has called a general election. The British people will vote and the winner will recieve a democractic mandate. If no party recieves a clear majority, the party with the most seats will be able to form a minority government, or attempt to enter a coalition with another party.\n\nTo be able to form a majority government, the winning party must win §Y336§!/§Y670§! seats\n\nCurrently the outcome of the election are as follows:\n\n§cConservative and Liberal Unionist Party§! - §Y[?ENG_future_conservative_seats]§!

ENG_1910_conservative_mechanic: "Conservative Minority Government"
ENG_1910_conservative_mechanic_desc: "Whilst our party controls the largest total amount of seats in government, we do not control a total majority. With no ability to form a coalition with any other parties, we are forced to rely upon the goodwill of individual MPs to support our government. Through concessions and limited reform, we can ensure our government survives. The longer we keep our current government in power the better we will perform in an election after this government falls - it is inevitable that the goodwill of individual MPs will run out eventually.\n\nIn terms of total support in the House of Commons, we currently hold the support of §Y[?ENG_con_mechanic_total_support]§!/§Y670§! MPs, a total of §Y336§! MPs need to support our government to prevent a collapse.\n\nWe currently hold the support of the following MPs:\n\n§cConservative and Liberal Unionist Party§! MPs: §Y[?ENG_con_mechanic_con_support]§!/§Y[?ENG_current_conservative_seats]§!\n\n§mLiberal Party§! MPs: §Y[?ENG_con_mechanic_lib_support]§!/§Y[?ENG_current_liberal_seats]§!\n\n§RLabour Party§!

ENG_1910_asquith_mechanic: "The Liberal Mandate"
ENG_1910_asquith_mechanic_desc: "The British Empire spans the globe, importing vast amounts of wealth into the British Isles. However, the common people of England still suffer some of the worst working conditions among the greatest European powers. Frankly, it is our duty as the Liberal Party to lay the foundation for a national welfare state that will uplift the deserving poor. Our government's mandate relies on the promises we made during our election campaign. If we fail to meet the major promises we made, the people will lose faith in our government. The Liberal Party itself is unstable and if we fail to fulfill our mandate we may see a revolt from inside the party itself.\n\nNot only must we look to the people of Britain, but to the situation in Ireland. We've made plenty of promises to the IPP about pushing forward with a new home rule bill, and due to our complete reliance on their support to stay in governance, we must follow up on these promises as soon as possible, lest our coalition falls apart."
ENG_ireland_mechanic_cat: "The Emerald Isle"
ENG_ireland_mechanic_cat_desc: "The British Isles consist of Great Britain, Ireland, and the surrounding smaller islands. All of these fall under the natural borders of the United Kingdom, of which the Emerald Isle has been a part since the 1801 Act of Union. Ireland has never exactly been content with their status within the kingdom, and over history, ever since the original Norman conquest, it has consistently revolted against English rule. The situation in Ireland can be likened to a ticking explosive; whilst all may be peaceful now, the matter of Irish identity and nationalism is still prevalent. The Irish parties in Westminster have proposed the idea of 'Home Rule', which would allow Ireland to have its own bicameral parliament within the United Kingdom and hence appease Irish nationalists whilst retaining the natural control of Westminster over Ireland. This proposal is supported by the Liberal Party, but until they topple the conservative stranglehold in the House of Lords, there is no chance of a bill being passed on the issue.\n\nFurthermore, Germany grows as a larger threat to our empire every day, and in the event of war with Germany, they may try to influence an Irish uprising against the British occupation.\n\nCurrently, the level of §GIrish Agitation§! is: [ENG_irish_agitation_level]\nCurrently, the level of §qGerman Influence§! in Ireland is: [ENG_german_influence_level]\n\n§RShould resistance grow too high, the Irish will attempt a violent uprising when the opportunity arises! Should we let German influence within the Irish nationalist circles become dominant, they will no doubt align themselves with the Central Powers.§!"

ww1_united_kingdom.1.t: "Asquith Petitions the King"
ww1_united_kingdom.1.d: "Earlier today the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, visited Buckingham Palace to ask the King to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. As expected of the King, he agreed to his Prime Minister's request and soon the elections will be announced the government.\n\nThe reasoning behind Asquith's request, lies in the fact that the Prime Minister needs a new mandate from the people to rally support in order to reform the privileges of the House of Lords, who have consistently blocked Asquith's attempts to implement home rule, new budgets or a multitude of social reforms. However, the Liberal Party's position in parliament is far from stable, forced into a coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party whilst only being a few seats ahead of the Conservative Party - they may lose this election, especially with the rise of the Labour Party on the horizon which has slowly chipped away at the Liberal's support on the left.\n\nThe Liberal Party has many obstacles ahead of its victory, and many more after that too. In times like this where Europe is dividing itself into factions, the empire must have a strong government to ensure the nation stays intact."
ww1_united_kingdom.1.a: "Good luck, Mr Prime Minister"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.t: "Asquith Requests the Appointment of New Liberal Peers"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.d: "Asquith's ambitions to reform the House of Lords rely heavily on the fact he can actually pass a parliament bill, obviously in the current state this would be impossible to pass through both chambers of government. Therefore the Prime Minister once again visited Buckingham Palace, this time to ask the King to mass appoint an adequate number of Liberal peers to carry the Parliament Bill once he had won the election. The King's late father, Edward VII had already rejected this proposal but in the interest of securing a stable government under the Liberals, and in the interest of the democratic mandate given by the people, it may be time to adhere to Asquith's demand.\n\nUnlike Asquith's ask to dissolve parliament, the King is well within his right to reject the Prime Minister's demands. However, the Liberal Government has threatened to resign if the King should refuse, forcing the King to call on the Conservative Party leader, Arthur Balfour to form a new minority government."
ww1_united_kingdom.2.a: "The King agrees"
ww1_united_kingdom.2.b: "The King refuses, let Asquith resign and summon Balfour"
ww1_united_kingdom.3.t: "The Government Announces a General Election"
ww1_united_kingdom.3.d: "The Liberal government under Prime Minister Asquith has announced to the nation that a general election will soon be held. The primary candidates are H. H. Asquith leading the Liberal Party and Arthur James Balfour leading the Conservative Party. This will be the second election of 1910 and will either cement Asquith's mandate or see a new Conservative government that will surely seek to reverse the social reform brought about under the previous administration."
ww1_united_kingdom.3.a: "Onwards to Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.4.t: "Liberal Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.4.d: "The results from the election are in, and we the Liberal Party have once again been given a democratic mandate from the British people. Once again we have been forced into a coalition with the IPP, meaning that once we have reformed the House of Lords, securing home rule must be a great priority of our government. H. H. Asquith continues his time as Prime Minister once again, only history shall know whether our task will turn out to be successful."
ww1_united_kingdom.4.a: "A cause for celebration"
ww1_united_kingdom.5.t: "Conservatives Begin Their Election Campaign"
ww1_united_kingdom.5.d: "The Conservative Party has begun its election campaign. Under the leadership of Balfour, they seem to be running a relatively unified campaign, much to our dismay, as it's blatantly obvious that in terms of party stability, the Conservatives take the lead on this matter.\n\nBalfour has made key points on tariff reforms and is campaigning hard against our social reforms, as well as the previous 'people's budget'."
ww1_united_kingdom.5.a: "We'd do best to follow suit"
ww1_united_kingdom.6.t: "Balfour Criticises Our Proposed Reforms"
ww1_united_kingdom.6.d: "Arthur Balfour, the leader of the Conservative Party, has recently focused his campaign efforts on criticising the possible effects of our proposed Parliament bill that would limit the power of the House of Lords.\n\nBalfour has called his bill an attack on personal wealth, and something that would radically alter the British constitution, going so far as to brand us as radicals who would do away with the two-chamber system. Admittedly, if we could demolish the House of Lords, it would make our job rather easy... Nonetheless his message has resonated with much of the electorate."
ww1_united_kingdom.6.a: "We won't give these lies merit through response."
ww1_united_kingdom.6.b: "Counter by highlighting the conservative stranglehold."
ww1_united_kingdom.7.t: "Labour on the Rise"
ww1_united_kingdom.7.d: "With the increase in strike action, the common people of Britain have been moved further and further left in recent years. The socialist labour party is the fastest-growing party in England, supported by the unions and holding the third largist minority in parliment. It seems inevitable that the labour party will continue to grow, one can hope this nonsense will die down eventually and a majority government can be formed."
ww1_united_kingdom.7.a: "Surely people can see this as the folly it is?"
ww1_united_kingdom.8.t: "Irish Nationalism on the Rise"
ww1_united_kingdom.8.d: "The Irish vote has been signficantly been swayed by the matter of home rule, whishing for the people of Ireland to have more representation for their own affairs. The IPP is a moderate party, whishing to ensure home rule in Ireland by working with the British parliment. Whilst this rise is expected, it doesn't help our chances at securing a electoral majority."
ww1_united_kingdom.8.a: "Will the Irish matter ever be resolved?"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.t: "Conservatives Fearmonger the State of the Empire"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.d: "With Britain being put back onto the European stage by our government, with the signing of the Entente Cordiale, it has sparked many questions on how our already overextended empire will cope. The conservatives have used this to criticise our government by claiming that we are risking the empire through inadequate government."
ww1_united_kingdom.9.a: "More lies that don't warrant a response"
ww1_united_kingdom.9.b: "Campaign for Imperial Stability"
ww1_united_kingdom.10.t: "Conservatives Finalise their Campaign"
ww1_united_kingdom.10.d: "The Conservatives have ended their campaign, just a few days before the end of the election trail. Conservatives across the nation are now hopeful for a victory in Parliament. We still have some time left to counter the conservative campaign."
ww1_united_kingdom.10.a: "We're sure to win this"
ww1_united_kingdom.11.t: "Conservative Victory"
ww1_united_kingdom.11.d: "The election results are in, the conservatives have been given a new mandate from the people! Arthur Balfour has been invited by the King to meet him at Buckingham Palace where Balfour will be asked to form a government in his majesty's name. This new conservative government will face significant problems due to their minority in parliament and inability to form a coalition - only time will tell if they can survive. Their first challenge will be to gather support in parliament based on the goodwill of MPs to pass a vote of confirmation, which will allow the conservatives to rule without holding a majority of parliament's seats through a coalition."
ww1_united_kingdom.11.a: "Time to turn Britain around!"
ww1_united_kingdom.12.t: "The Government Resigns"
ww1_united_kingdom.12.d: "With the King refusing Asquith's demand to expand with the House of Lords through the mass appointment of new liberal peers, the current government has resigned. Soon after this announcement, Arthur Balfour, the leader of the conservative party, was summoned by the King and invited to form a new government. This new conservative government will face significant problems due to their minority in parliament and inability to form a coalition - only time will tell if they can survive. Their first challenge will be to gather support in parliament based on the goodwill of MPs to pass a vote of confirmation, which will allow the conservatives to rule without holding a majority of parliament's seats through a coalition."
ww1_united_kingdom.12.a: "Balfour can do it! Right?"
ww1_united_kingdom.13.t: "Liberal Support and the King's Opening of Parliment"
ww1_united_kingdom.13.d: "Our new Conservative government is unable to form a willing coalition with any other party in parliament. It therefore must rely on the goodwill of individual MPs in parliament to stay in power. Luckily for us, the leader of the Liberal Party, and former Prime Minister, Herbert Henry Asquith, has endorsed our government and hence recommended to his party that they keep faith in this new government. The support of Asquith has ensured the success of our initial government. Tomorrow the King will open the parliament and the true work of our government will begin. It will be an upward battle from here on out to keep our party in government."
ww1_united_kingdom.13.a: "Now we must ensure parliment continues to support our government"

ww1_united_kingdom.16.t: "Britain Proposes a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.16.d: "The British parliament has extended an invitation to commit to a joint training mission between our two armies. The mission would consist of a multitude of standard exercises between the two, with the intention of keeping our armed forces up to date and better the coordination between our two forces."
ww1_united_kingdom.16.a: "Naturally!"
ww1_united_kingdom.16.b: "What a waste of our time"
ww1_united_kingdom.17.t: "France Agrees to a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.17.d: "As expected, the French government has agreed to our proposal and soon our armed forces will embark on a joint training mission."
ww1_united_kingdom.17.a: "It'll be some good practice for the boys"
ww1_united_kingdom.18.t: "France Refuses our Offer of a Joint Training Mission"
ww1_united_kingdom.18.d: "To the confusion of many in the British government, it seems the French have declined our request to commit to a joint training mission. The reasons why are unknown, all we have is the vauge excuses from the French Foreign Minister."
ww1_united_kingdom.18.a: "Huh?"
